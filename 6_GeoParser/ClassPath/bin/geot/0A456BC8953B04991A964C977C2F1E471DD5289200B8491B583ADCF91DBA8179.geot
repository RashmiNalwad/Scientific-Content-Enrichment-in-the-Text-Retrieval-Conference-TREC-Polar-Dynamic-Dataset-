    Summary

    
    

    
    	

    
        
            Abstract: 
            ELSeWeb is a NASA ACCESS-funded project that began in February 2012 to tackle the challenge of making Earth Science data more easily used in scientific studies of biological forecasting . The goal of ELSeWeb is to leverage semantic technologies being developed at Cyber-ShARE to enable:

- Automated discovery, transformation, and ingestion of Earth Science data at the Earth Data Analysis Center (EDAC) into the Lifemapper Species Distribution Modeling Service;

- Capture and visualization of the entire provenance of output datasets from their original NASA source through EDAC and Lifemapper processing; and

- Easier visualization of input and output datasets. 

This is accomplished using a Cyber-ShARE knowledge base developed specifically for ELSeWeb and semantic tools, including Semantic Automated Discovery & Integration (SADI) Services, reuse of the SADI's SHARE client for semantic orchestration of SADI Services, WebProbe to display provenance, and the Visualization Knowledge (VisKo) Service to automatically generate visualizations.
