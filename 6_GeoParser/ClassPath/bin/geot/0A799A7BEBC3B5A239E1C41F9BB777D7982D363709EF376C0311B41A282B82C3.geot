NASA Invites Reporters to Observe Robotics Tests in Arizona Desert 
 

 
 
WASHINGTON -- NASA will hold the annual Desert "RATS," or Research and Technology Studies, field test in the Arizona desert this fall, hosting a media day for journalists on Sept. 15. 
 
  Desert RATS will help determine what technologies and capabilities will be needed when NASA takes future trips beyond Earth. The tests will include a simulated 14-day mission during which two crew members -- an astronaut and a geologist -- will live inside NASA's prototype Lunar Electric Rover. They will scout the test area for features of geological interest and conduct simulated moonwalks to collect samples. 
  
 NASA's heavy-lift rover Tri-ATHLETE, or All-Terrain Hex-Legged Extra-Terrestrial Explorer, will carry a habitat mockup to which the lunar rover will dock. The media day will include lunar rover and Tri-ATHLETE demonstrations and opportunities to interview the engineers, scientists and astronauts involved in the tests. 
  
 Interested reporters should contact Brandi Dean at 281-244-1403 by Friday, Sept. 11, for the media day agenda and registration information. Access to the test site is restricted, and reporters must register in advance. NASA requires a letter of assignment on company letterhead for credentials. 
  
 During the Desert RATS tests, which have been taking place for more than a decade, engineers from NASA centers work with representatives from industry and academia.
