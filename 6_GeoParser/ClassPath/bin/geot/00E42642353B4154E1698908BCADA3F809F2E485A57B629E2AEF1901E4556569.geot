        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The present-day observed change in sea level is the sum of several factors, including the continuing readjustment of the crust to the past redistribution of the surface ice-water load and any present-day melting of the Antarctic ice sheet. Constraints can be provided on both of these contributions by measuring the magnitude of the crustal rebound using the Global Positioning System. By combining  ... the measurements with other estimates of sea-level change, it becomes possible to separate the two contributions. This will lead to both improved mass balance models for the ice-ocean system and improved understanding of present sea-level change.

 Diagnostic Data: 
 The diagnostic data are updated on a daily basis for those sites which have active satellite communication facilities. For other sites, the data are only retrieved on an opportunistic basis as it has to be physically downloaded from the machine. Diagnostic data are only available from 2000 onwards. 
 
 Diagnostic data were collected at a test site, davi, located at Davis during 2000. The equipment was subsequently removed and redeployed in the PCMs after 2000. We did not install a GPS receiver at Davis; only diagnostic data were collected by the test installation. 
 
 Further information about the Richardson Lake site is available from the URL given below. 
 
 This work was completed as part of ASAC project 1112 - Crustal rebound in the Lambert Glacier area.

 Taken from the 2008-2009 Progress Report: 
 Public summary of the season progress: 
 Successful automated operation of remote GPS installations in Antarctica and transmission of the data via satellite communications led to the accurate estimation of uplift rates at several sites in the Prince Charles Mountains and Enderby Land. These velocities help interpret mass balance changes as estimated from space gravity. The project was finalised and most equipment was removed. One site has not been visited since 2004 and the equipment still needs to be retrieved.

        Quality
        
            Taken from the 2008-2009 Progress Report: 
 Variations to work plan or objectives: 
 The project has now finished. The equipment have been removed from the sites that the field party were able to visit. However, we must gain access to Komsomolskiy Peak in order to remove the equipment that is there. 
 
 Field work: 
  ... We did not send a field party in the 2008/09 season. The GA surveyors visited our sites at Landing Bluff, Beaver Lake and Dalton Corner and removed the equipment. We still need to access two sites that we were unable to access this season: Richardson Lake and Komsomolskiy Peak. 
 
 Laboratory activity/analysis: 
 The GPS data retrieved to date have been analysed. We are awaiting the return of our equipment from the 2008/09 season to fill the gaps of the data that were not transmitted successfully by satellite, then will publish the results. 

        
    



            
            
            







    
        Access Constraints
        
            The full GPS dataset will be available to the general public after 5 year embargo period beginning January 12, 1998. 
 
 Currently 1998-2002 data are available. 
 
 GPS Data may be made available before this time under special arrangements. Diagnostic data available now from the url given below. 
 
 The data have been gzipped and hatanaka compressed. Un-gzipping the files will convert them to readable ascii files.
