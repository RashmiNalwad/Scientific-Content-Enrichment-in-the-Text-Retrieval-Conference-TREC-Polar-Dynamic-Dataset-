Just Passing By Venus
The Moon will skim by Venus for a dazzling sky 
show on June 16thJune 14, 1999: For the second time in less than a month
the planet Venus and the Moon are poised to put on a spectacular
show for stargazers. 



 Last Friday, June 11, Venus reached its greatest apparent
distance from the sun in 1999 (45o).  For the rest of June
 and most of July 
the second planet from the sun lies 30 to 40 degrees above the 
western horizon as the sun sets.  Blazing at magnitude -4.3, it's nearly impossible to miss.
Venus is so bright that it is frequently mistaken for an 
airplane or a UFO.


Right: Artist Duane Hilton created this
image showing the June 16th close encounter between Venus and the Moon as they
would appear over the horizon of Utah's Bryce Canyon after sunset.
As viewed through
    a telescope Venus will look like a tiny quarter Moon
    approximately 25 arcseconds across.  The planet Mercury also makes an appearance this week, shining low on
          the western horizon at magnitude -0.2.
 




On Wednesday, June 16, sparkling Venus will gain a companion.
The slender crescent moon will skim by Venus, passing just 3 
degrees below the bright planet.  It's a 
lovely sight that stargazers won't want to miss.
Because Venus and the Moon are so bright they should
    be visible even through the glare of urban lights. 




There will be another close encounter with Venus in June, but this
one won't be visible to the naked eye.  On June 24, NASA's Cassini 
spacecraft -- bound for Saturn -- will fly by Venus
on its way to the outer solar system.  

Cassini will fly about 600 kilometers (373 miles) from Venus, 
gaining a boost in speed from that planet's
gravity. In August, Cassini flies past Earth at an altitude 
of 1,166 kilometers (725 miles), about five times higher than the
Space Shuttle's orbit. The Earth swingby will 
bend Cassini's flight path toward Jupiter, where Cassini will perform yet
another flyby at a distance of 9.7 million kilometers (6 million miles), using Jupiter's gravity to swing the spacecraft on to its
final destination of Saturn.

Venus is a popular place for such
maneuvers.  The image below shows Venus as it was seen by the
Galileo spacecraft when it flew by the planet on its way to Jupiter in 
1990.



Right: This colorized image of Venus
    was recorded by the Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft shortly
    after its gravity assist flyby of Venus in February of 1990.
    Galileo's glimpse of the veiled planet shows structure in swirling
    sulfuric acid clouds. The bright area is sunlight glinting off
    the upper cloud deck. The pressure of Venus's atmosphere at the surface is 90 atmospheres,
    about the same as the pressure at a depth of 1 km in Earth's
    oceans. The air is consists mainly of carbon dioxide and there
    are several layers of clouds many kilometers thick composed of
    sulfuric acid. This dense atmosphere produces a runaway greenhouse
    effect that raises the surface temperature to over 850
    o
     F -- hot enough to melt lead. This makes Venus's
    surface hotter than Mercury's, despite being nearly twice as
    far from the Sun.more

Moonlight & Earthshine

   Wednesday's close encounter between Venus and the Moon
should be an enjoyable
    sight, but there's more: Cradled in the arms of the slim crescent
    Moon will appear the ghostly outline of the full Moon, a dim
    glow that astronomers call "Earthshine."

  Like all the planets we see in the night sky, the Moon does not
    shine by its own light. It reflects sunlight. The side of the
    Moon facing the sun shines brightly, and the side facing away
    is nearly dark. The only significant illumination on the "dark
    side of the Moon" 
    is due to Earthshine -- sunlight that bounces off the Earth and
    falls on the lunar surface. A slender crescent Moon with Earthshine
    is widely regarded as one of the most delicate and beautiful
    sights in the night sky. It will be difficult to see from urban
    areas, but should be easy to view from dark sky locations. 


        
    For those readers with a telescope, a look at
    Venus on Wednesday will be a rewarding sight.
    Because Venus is closer to the sun than Earth, it appears from
    our vantage point to have phases like the Moon. As viewed through
    a telescope on June 16th Venus will look like a tiny quarter Moon
    approximately 25 arcseconds across. Forty-six percent of the visible
    disk will be illuminated. 



    If you do look at Venus through a telescope don't expect to see
    any surface features. The planet is completely veiled by clouds.
    In fact, that's why Venus is so bright. Its dense cloud layer
    reflects most of the sunlight shining down on the planet.

Mercury Rising

The planet Mercury also makes 
an appearance this week, shining low on the western horizon
at magnitude -0.2.  Mercury is rarely easy to see because it 
is always near
the Sun, and picking it out of the Sun's glare can be
difficult.  Mercury will be making one of its best 
appearances of the year
during the last week of June when its elongation, or
apparent distance from the Sun, reaches 25.5 degrees.  Perhaps the
best day to view Mercury this week will be Tuesday, June 15, 
when Mercury lies 22 degrees from the
Sun and the delicate crescent moon will be about midway between 
Mercury and 
Venus.  An unobstructed view of the horizon is absolutely required
for a clear view of the nearest planet to the Sun.
