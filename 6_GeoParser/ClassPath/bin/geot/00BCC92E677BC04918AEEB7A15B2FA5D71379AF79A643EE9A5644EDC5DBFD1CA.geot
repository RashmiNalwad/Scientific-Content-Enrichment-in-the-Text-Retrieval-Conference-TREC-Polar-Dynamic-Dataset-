                    Project Description

                    
                        
                            
                            
                                 A number of governmental agencies cooperatively conduct Japanese 
 Antarctic research under the name of the Japanese Antarctic 
 Research Expedition (JARE). All decisions and approval of 
 proposals for research activities rest with the Headquarters of 
 JARE under the chairmanship of the Minister of Education, 
 Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. The Secretariat of the 
 JARE Headquarters belongs to the Science and International 
 Affairs Bureau, Monbukagakusho. The task of NIPR is to operate 
 JARE both for scientific programs and logistics, except the 
 transportation of personnel and materials by the icebreaker 
 Shirase from Japan to Antarctica. Scientific programs at Syowa 
 Station cover the following fields: upper atmosphere physics, 
 meteorology, seismology, gravimetry, geodesy and cartography, 
 oceanography, glaciology, geology, geography, marine and 
 terrestrial biology, and medical research. Programs offered on 
 board the Shirase include the following subjects: ionosphere, 
 meteorology, geomagnetism, gravimetry, and physical, chemical 
 and biological oceanography. All Japanese scientific stations 
 in Antarctica belong to NIPR. Syowa Station, the mother station 
 of JARE, was established in January 1957, at 69?00'S and 
 39?35'E on East Ongul Island, Lutzow-Holm Bay, East 
 Antarctica. The total floor area of the buildings has increased 
 from 184m? (3 buildings) in 1957 to 5,930.5m? (48 buildings) 
 and other outdoor facilities in 2001. Mizuho Station was 
 established in July 1970 along the geomagnetic meridian passing 
 through Syowa Station. It is located on the inland ice sheet at 
 70?42'S and 44?20'E (2,230m above sea level), about 270km 
 southeast of Syowa. After intermittent occupation, a few 
 members maintained year-round operation from 1976 to 1986, 
 making observations on meteorology, glaciology, and upper 
 atmosphere physics. It has been closed since 1987 and is 
 occasionally visited by some parties for meteorological and 
 glaciological observations. Asuka Station was established in 
 December 1984 on the ice sheet north of the Sor-Rondane 
 Mountains, at 71?32'S and 24?08'E (930m above sea level). Most 
 of the station facilities of about 450m? in total floor area 
 have become buried under snow. The principal role of the 
 station is to support field work in geology, geomorphology, 
 meteorite searches, glaciology and biology in the Sor-Rondane 
 Mountains. However, year-round observations including 
 meteorology, glaciology, solid earth geophysics, and upper 
 atmosphere physics were conducted between 1987 to 1991. Since 
 1991, the station activities have been suspended. Dome Fuji 
 Station equipped with 8 buildings, 407m? in total, was 
 established in 1995 at 77?19'01"S and 39?42'12"E (3,810m above 
 sea level) for the deep drilling program and atmospheric 
 observations. In recent years, environmental protection of 
 Antarctica and its unique ecosystems has become increasingly 
 important in planning and conducting Antarctic research. In 
 accordance with the protocol on environmental protection in the 
 Antarctic Treaty, appropriate procedures for environmental 
 protection are followed in the Japanese Antarctic Research 
 Expeditions. A new program for monitoring changes in global 
 and regional environments and ecosystems was started at Syowa 
 Station and its coastal and inland vicinity in 1997. The 
 monitoring programs include major parameters of atmospheric 
 glaciological, solid geophysical and biological changes, such 
 as atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, sea level, 
 population of penguins etc. Pollutants in seawater, ice or snow 
 and in animals, such as heavy metals and organic chlorinated 
 compounds derived from global and regional sources, are 
 occasionally measured. The monitoring of global environmental 
 change is an essential part of basic scientific programs as 
 described in the previous chapter.
