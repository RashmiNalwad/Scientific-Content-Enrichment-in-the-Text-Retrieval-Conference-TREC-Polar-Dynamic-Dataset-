        Summary


        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            This is an exospheric model of the solar wind with only protons and electrons 
 (we defer the inclusion of heavy ions to upcoming versions of the code), with a 
 non-monotonic total potential for the protons and with a Lorentzian (kappa) 
 velocity distribution function (VDF) for the electrons. This code is developed 
 for the coronal holes. 
 
 Exospheric kinetic models assume that there is a sharp level called the 
 exobase, separating a collision dominated region (where a fluid approximation 
 is valid) from a region fully collisionless. In fact, there is a transition 
 region where collisions between particles become less and less numerous when 
 the distance to the Sun increases.
