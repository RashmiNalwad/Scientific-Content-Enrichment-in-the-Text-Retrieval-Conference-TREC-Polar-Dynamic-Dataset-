                            Abstract: 
                            The Burning Risk Advisory Support System (BRASS) provides continuous means for forest and grassland managers to assess vegetation and weather to support decisions related to prescribed burning and/or the risk of wildfire. 
 
 The key management objective of BRASS is to provide a decision support tool to aid in management of rangelands, prescribed fires and wildfires, and livestock grazing. The  ... system is comprised of three parts, 1) a near-real time plant growth model, PHYGROW, that is updated daily utilizing current and historical weather conditions from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 2) a fire simulation model called PHYRESIM, that uses the same core functionality that drives the highly respected BEHAVE Plus burning application, 3) a fire growth model called PHYREFLY that is a derivative of the FARSITE fire growth simulator. The PHYGROW model provides the fuel loads and live moisture contents on a daily basis for each vegetation polygon in the project area. The PHYRESIM model is then run for each vegetation polygon to simulate dead fuel moisture, spread rate, flame height, and fire intensity. A fire danger advisory map is the produced from these values for a forecasted time period of 6 days. The PHYREFLY fire growth model is run on-demand when a fire is present using the latest available data to predict the area covered by a fire at 30 minute intervals. The PHYREFLY model can be used to simulate fires for a period of up to 6 days.

            Field work: 
 All field work for CEAMARC was completed. 
 Aurora Australis - 20 on-site ship days during the 42-day V3/CEAMARC CASO Voyage between 139 degrees and 145 degrees E and 67 degrees and 65 degrees 20' S. Sampling was conducted with AAD beam trawl (AADBT) (mounted with either video or still camera), Agassiz beam trawl, box corer the Geosciences Australia  ... remotely operated video and CTD, with occasional samples using an epibenthic sledge. 88 sites were sampled. 
 
 Umitaka Maru - 15 on-site ship days between 140 degrees and 145 degrees E and south of 62 degrees S. Sampling was conducted at various fixed depths between the surface and 2,000 m using WP2, Norpac, and salp plankton nets, multinet, RMT1+8 midwater trawl, IYGPT midwater trawl, as well as a video plankton profiler and CTDs. This produced more than 300 plankon/fish net samples at 24 sites. 31 CTD casts were made with phytoplankton and water samples collected at set depths at each site for 264 phytoplankton samples. 
 
 L'Astrolabe - 10 on-site ship days between 140 degrees and 145 degrees 40'E and south of 65 degrees 50'S. Sampling was conducted with WP2 and bongo plankton nets, and CTD and bottles for phytoplankton. This produced 36 zooplankton samples and 112 phytoplankton samples at 20 stations. 
 
 Laboratory activity/analysis: 
 All demersal fish and benthic samples for taxonomic analysis were sent directly to the National Natural History Museum (MNHN) in Paris. Samples were distributed to taxonomic experts within and without the museum in Europe. WP2 net samples collected on Umitaka Maru, and the WP2 and bongo net samples, were analysed at the University of Liege STARESO Marine Station, Corsica. The IYGPT fish samples from Umitaka Maru were processed at the University of Paris VI - Zoology Station at Villefranche-sur-mer. The remaining plankton and fish samples from Umitaka Maru were processed at TUMSAT and AAD laboratories.
