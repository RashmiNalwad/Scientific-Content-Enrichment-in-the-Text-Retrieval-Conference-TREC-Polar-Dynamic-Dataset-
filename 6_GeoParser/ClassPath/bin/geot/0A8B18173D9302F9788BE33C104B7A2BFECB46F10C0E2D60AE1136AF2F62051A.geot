        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS) started to maintain and 
 continue the collection of information on ongoing glacier changes. 
 The Mass Balance Bulletin (MBB), a large part of the WGMS, contains 
 data documenting changes in glaciers through time (changes in mass, 
 volume, area and length of glaciers). 
 
 Two main categories of data - summary information and  ... extensive 
 information - are being reported on in the Glacier Mass Balance 
 Bulletin. Summary information on specific balance, cumulative specific 
 balance, accumulation area ratio and equilibrium line altitude is 
 given for 60 glaciers. Such information provides a regional 
 overview. In addition, extensive information such as balance maps, 
 balance/altitude diagrams, relations between accumulation area ratios, 
 equilibrium line altitudes and balance, as well as a short explanatory 
 text with a photograph, are presented for 11 selected glaciers with 
 existing long and complete series of direct glaciological 
 measurements. These long time-series based on high density networks of 
 stakes and firn pits are especially valuable for analyzing processes 
 of mass and energy exchange at glacier/atmosphere interfaces and, 
 hence, for interpreting climate/glacier relations. 
 
 This data covers is for 1980 to 2003.
