    Description

    
         
            
            
                Soil heat probes determine the soil moisture content 


		
            
                 by measuring the time taken for a known pulse of heat to 


		
            
                 dissipate into the soil. The wetter the soil, the quicker 


		
            
                 the heat dissipates. Heat probe sensors can be linked to 


		
            
                 a data logger to take continuous readings.
