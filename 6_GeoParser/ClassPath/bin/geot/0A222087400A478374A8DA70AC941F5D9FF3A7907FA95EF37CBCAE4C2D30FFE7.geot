        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            This data set provides surface elevation and ice thickness data for a portion of the Marie Byrd Land sector of West Antarctica, including the Ford Ranges, the Sulzberger Ice Shelf, much of the Edward VII Peninsula, and the Shirase Coast region of the eastern Ross Ice Shelf. The investigators used radar sounding and laser altimetry from a Twin Otter aircraft flying at varying altitudes, at least 300 m above the surface, at an air speed of about 130 knots. Surveys were accomplished with 64 flights in December 1998 and January 1999. This research was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) contract NSF OPP 9615281.
