	Brief description



IGLOS-PP was a Pilot Project initiated in 2000 to track and analyze data from the Russian GLONASS
satellite constellation.  It also serves as an important demonstration of 
integrating new constellations and signals into the IGS framework. IGLOS-PP was a follow-on to the 1998-1999 International GLONASS Experiment, led by Pascal Willis (IGN).  The IGLOS-PP was terminated at the request of the Chair at the end of 2005, because GLONASS data and products had been successfully integrated into the standard operations of the IGS.
