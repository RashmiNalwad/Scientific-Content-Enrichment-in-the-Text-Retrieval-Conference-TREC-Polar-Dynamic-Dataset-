        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Holocene marine invertebrates and subfossil avian assemblages were 
 found within marine deposits elevated 1.17-16.7 m a.s.l. on the coasts 
 of Potter Peninsula, King George Island. Early Holocene Laternula sp 
 shells in live position were found within mudy sediments deposited in 
 an open fjord during a sea level high stand, which may reflect the 
 early Holocene eustatic marine transgression that  ... drowned the south 
 coast of KGI down to 25-30 m depths. Mid-Holocene penguin and flying 
 bird remains accompanied by seal bones were discovered within raised 
 marine beach sediments (2.4-16.7 m), which reflect high relative sea 
 levels during two mid-Holocene episodes (c. 6400 years BP, and c. 4500 
 years BP) of seasonally open marine conditions. These episodes may 
 coincide with a cooling period around Antarctica estimated from 
 ice-core records between 8000-4000 years BP that preceded the "climate 
 optimum" in the Antarctic Peninsula (4000-3000 yr BP). Additionally 
 late Holocene penguin bones were found in abandoned penguin rookeries 
 located on a raised marine terrace 30-50 m. Paleontological evidence 
 suggests that these rookeries may have been intermitently active since 
 2000 years BP, and up to 700 years BP when the site was definitively 
 abandoned by penguins during a recent climate cooling.
