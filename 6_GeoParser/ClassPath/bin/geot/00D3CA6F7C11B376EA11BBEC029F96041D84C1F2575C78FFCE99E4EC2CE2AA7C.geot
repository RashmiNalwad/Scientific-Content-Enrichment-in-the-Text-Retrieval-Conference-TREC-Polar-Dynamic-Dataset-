ABSTRACT 

The project aims at validating AMSR-E and AMSU/HSB products at high latitudes 
  (50-70 degrees north). Validation will be done on retrieved. The validation 
  will focus on the Baltic region, thus covering a high latitude area, which complements 
  existing validation efforts in the mid-latitudes and tropics. As validation 
  datasets, operational radiosounding and surface reports, as well as output of 
  an operational mesoscale model (HIRLAM, run at SMHI), will be available. For 
  precipitation retrieval validation we will use the unique, high-density gauge-calibrated 
  radar dataset collected and provided by the Baltic Sea Experiment?s (BALTEX) 
  Radar Data Centre (BRDC). BRDC is operated by the Swedish Meteorological and 
  Hydrological Institute (SMHI). BRDC aims at collecting data from as many radars 
  and gauges in or proximate to the Baltic region as possible, deriving and archiving 
  homogenous data sets. During the Main Observational Phase (October 1999-February 
  2002), data will be available from 25 radars in six countries covering the entire 
  Baltic region every 15 minutes. 

  A number of distinct AMSR-E and AMSU/HSB products will be validated. Here we 
  list the different parameters that will be validated. 

1. Level 1 Beam pointing accuracy of AMSU/HSB, AMSR-E. We will assess the accuracy 
  of the navigation of AMSU, HSB, and AMSR-E 

  2. Level 2 of AMSR-E cloud liquid water. We will validate AMSR-E cloud liquid 
  water retrievals using MODIS as a reference for cloud-free areas. 

3. Level 2 Accuracy of AMSR-E and precipitation algorithm over land. The validation 
  of precipitation products will involve standard statistical comparison of gauge-calibrated 
  radar data with the precipitation retrievals as well as forward modeling based 
  on NWP and radar data. 

4. Level 2 Accuracy of AMSR-E precipitation algorithm over water. The profiling 
  algorithm proposed for AMSR-E will be validated for high latitudes via comparison 
  with three-dimensional radar volume scans. 

5. Level 2 Accuracy of AMSU/HSB precipitation. AMSU/HSB precipitation screening 
  and retrieval will be assessed for high latitudes.
