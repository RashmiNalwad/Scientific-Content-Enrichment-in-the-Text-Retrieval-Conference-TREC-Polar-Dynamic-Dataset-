                            Abstract: 
                            Land Cover Trends was a research project focused on understanding the rates, trends, causes, and consequences of contemporary U.S. land use and land cover change. The project spanned from 1999 to 2011. Ongoing research is being conducted as part of the Land Change Research Project. 
 
 Objectives were to: 
 
 - Develop a comprehensive methodology for using sampling and change analysis techniques and Landsat MSS and TM data for measuring land cover change in 85 U.S. ecoregions. 
 
 - Estimate the types, rates, and temporal variability of change for each ecoregion. 
 
 - Document regional driving forces and consequences of change. Prepare a national synthesis of land cover change.
