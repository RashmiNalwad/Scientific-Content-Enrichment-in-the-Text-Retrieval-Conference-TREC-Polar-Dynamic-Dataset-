        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            A component of U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) is the 
 Arabian Sea Process Study. Eleven cruises took place aboard the R/V 
 Thomas G. Thompson for about sixteen months from October 1994 until 
 January 1996. These cruises provided seasonal coverage of the annual 
 monsoon and inter-monsoon cycles in the area southeast of Oman - from 
  ... where the cruises were staged. The monsoons of the Arabian Sea drive 
 a uniquely intense carbon cycling system, and it is the goal of JGOFS 
 to better understand the role of the oceans in global carbon cycling. 
 
 CTD data are given at 2 decibar pressure intervals (for the 
 intercalibration cruise, CTD data are given at one decibar pressure 
 intervals). The following data were collected: temperature, 
 conductivity, salinity, potential temperature, density (sigma-t), and 
 potential density (sigma theta). 
 
 Mixed layer depths are given in decibars and were calculated at the 
 change in density of 0.03 kg/m^3 and at the change in density of 0.125 
 kg/m^3. 
 
 Beam attenuation, backscattered light, and relative fluorescence data 
 are also included for most CTD casts.
