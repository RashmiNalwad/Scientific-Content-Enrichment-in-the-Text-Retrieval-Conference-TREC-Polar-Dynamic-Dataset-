        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Estimates of spawning habitat for white sturgeons Acipenser 
 transmontanus in the tailraces of the four dams on the lower 470 km of 
 the Columbia River were obtained by using the Physical Habitat 
 Simulation System of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Instream 
 Flow Incremental Methodology to identify areas with suitable water 
 depths, water velocities, and substrates. Rearing  ... habitat throughout 
 the lower Columbia River was assessed by using a geographic 
 information system to identify areas with suitable water depths and 
 substrates. The lowering of spring and summer river discharges from 
 hydropower system operation reduces the availability of spawning 
 habitat for white sturgeons. The four dam tailraces in the study area 
 differ in the amount and quality of spawning habitat available at 
 various discharges: the differences are due to channel morphology. 
 The three impoundments and the free-flowing Columbia River downstream 
 from Bonneville Dam provide extensive areas that are physically 
 suitable for rearing young-of-the-year and juvenile white sturgeons. 
 
 
 Geographic Description: 
 
 This study was conducted in the Columbia River from the mouth 
 (river kilometer 0) to McNary Dam (river km 470). The four dams 
 
 within the study area are operated primarily for hydroelectric power 
 generation and divide the river into three impoundments, Bonneville 
 Pool, The Dalles Pool, and John Day Pool, and a free-flowing river 
 reach. Bonneville Dam was closed in 1938, The Dalles Dam in 1957, John 
 Day Dam in 1967, and McNary Dam was closed in 1953. The four river 
 reaches differ in length, surface area, and other physical 
 characteristics. 
 
 Methodology: 
 
 Physical Habitat Simulation System (PHABSIM) used to evaluate 
 habitat available for spawning white sturgeons by determining the 
 relation between river discharge and spawning habitat downstream from 
 each dam within the study area. Determines the overall quality of 
 habitat of a particular unit of area of the river.

 substrates for white sturgeon spawning habitat.
