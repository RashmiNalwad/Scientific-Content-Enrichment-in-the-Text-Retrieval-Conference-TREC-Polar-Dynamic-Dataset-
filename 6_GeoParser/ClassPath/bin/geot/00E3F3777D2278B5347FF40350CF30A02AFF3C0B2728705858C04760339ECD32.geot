                Definition:

                
                    Air in motion relative to the surface of the Earth. Since vertical
components of atmospheric motion are relatively small especially near the
surface of the Earth, meteorologists use the term to denote almost
exclusively the horizontal (wind) component. Vertical winds are always
identified as such.
