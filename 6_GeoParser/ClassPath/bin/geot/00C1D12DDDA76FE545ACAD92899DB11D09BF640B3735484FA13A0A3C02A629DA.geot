        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                             The Terra/MODIS Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) product (MOD17A2) is a cumulative composite of GPP values based on the radiation-use efficiency concept that is potentially used as inputs to data models to calculate terrestrial energy, carbon, water cycle processes, and biogeochemistry of vegetation. MOD17A2 is an 8-day composite at 1-km spatial resolution delivered as a gridded level-4 product  ... in Sinusoidal projection. 
 
 The MODIS Adaptive Processing System (MODAPS) at the Goddard Spaceflight Center produces this GPP product. Users are encouraged to use the Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group (NTSG)/University of Montana’s (UMT) version of this product available as version-55 from the LP DAAC. For more information, refer to the product details via the “Version 055” tab. 
 
 Version-5 and Version-55 Terra/MODIS GPP products are validated to Stage-3; this means that its accuracy was assessed and uncertainties in the product were well-established via independent measurements made in a systematic and statistically robust way that represents global conditions. These data are deemed ready for use in science applications.
