                            Abstract: 
                            The NSF-supported research icebreaker Nathaniel B. Palmer operates year-round in support of the U.S. Antarctic Program, carrying out global change studies in biological, chemical, physical, and oceanographic disciplines. 
 This data set consists of underway data from leg NBP0801 on the R/V Nathaniel B. Palmer. This leg started at Lyttelton, New Zealand and ended at Lyttelton, New Zealand.
