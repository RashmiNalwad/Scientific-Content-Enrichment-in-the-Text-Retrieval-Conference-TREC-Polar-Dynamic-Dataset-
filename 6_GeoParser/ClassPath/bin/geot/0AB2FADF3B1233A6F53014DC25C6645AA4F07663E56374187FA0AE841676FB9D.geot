                            Abstract: 
                            This product has been decommissioned. 
 
 The MODIS level 2G 1km Surface Reflectance data state QA product, MOD09GST, is a restructured version of its primary input, the state QA data in MOD09_L2. This product summarizes the quality of the MOD09 products, specifically atmospheric and other correction states. The product contains quality assurance data pertaining to cloud and cloud shadow, land and  ... water designations, aerosols, and the data source of corrections performed on the file. The dataset contains two Science Data Sets (SDSs); reflectance data state quality assurance and the number of observations for each pixel.
