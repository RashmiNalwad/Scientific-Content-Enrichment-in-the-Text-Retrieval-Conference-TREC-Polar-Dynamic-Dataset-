                        ---- Public Summary from Project ----
                        Longline fisheries represent a serious threat to the survival of Southern Ocean albatrosses and petrels. During line setting
                        operations seabirds become entangled with baited hooks and are drawn underwater and drown. In the past 10-20 years populations
                        of some species have decreased at an alarming rate and some species are considered to be threatened with extinction. The Antarctic
                        Divisions seabird by-catch program is attempting to minimise mortality in longline fisheries by a multi-faceted approach involving
                        mitigation research on fishing vessels, research on seabirds and initiatives of a semi-political nature.
                        
                        We chartered F/V Assassin for three days to trial a series of line weighting regimes under fishing conditions experienced
                        in the east coast tuna fishery. Sink rates of lines with 52 combinations of swivel weight, bait type and bottom length were
                        recorded.
                        
                        In Mooloolaba they don't use leaded swivels. Therefore it is an unweighted snood.

                        indicate the factors tested in the experiment, and the order in which they were undertaken.  The Tuncurry_order_of_sets.xls
                        file is the order in which the snoods (numbered by regime code) were put out during each line set. Should be read in conjunction
                        with the metadata file. The D1, D2, D3 numbers denote the end of a working day when we downloaded the data from the day's
                        line sets (4 on day 1, 6 on day 2, 5 on day 3).

                        Taken from the 2008-2009 Progress Report:
                        Progress against objectives:
                        We have consolidated two research streams for pelagic longline fisheries. One is to conduct "conventional" mitigation research,
                        principally focussing on methods to expedite gear sink rates, and the other is to develop an underwater bait delivery system
                        for tuna and swordfish gear. Both streams are dealt with below.
                        
                        The conventional research focuses on operational aspects of gear, and at this stage does not involve seabird avoidance research
                        (this will come later).
                        
                        In the last 12 months I have a) completed a designed experiment on a chartered tuna vessel off Mooloolaba, Queensland, examining
                        the effect of mainline tension (created by use of a line shooter) on the sink rate of baited hooks in the shallow depth ranges;
                        b) a designed experiment in Coquimbo, Chile (as part of Birdlife Internationals Albatross Task Force) examining the effect
                        on initial sink rates of the five branch line deployment methods used by tuna vessels in the southern hemisphere, and c) completed
                        five weeks in Mooloolaba with a chartered fishing vessel and in collaboration with DeBrett's Seafoods and Amerro Engineering,
                        on the R&D of the underwater setting machine.
                        
                        Taken from the 2009/2010 Progress Report:
                        
                        In the past 12 months research work has focussed on:
                        
                        a) the development of the underwater bait setting capsule,
                        b) the effects of propeller turbulence on the sink rates of baited tuna hooks, 
                        c) the effect of improved line weighting on the catch rates of fish taxa.
                        
                        We have made considerable progress with the underwater setting machine and are intending to complete a "proof-of-concept"
                        experiment with the device in Uruguay this winter/spring. Project "b" was completed on two vessels (one in Chile and one in
                        Australia, as opportunities arose) and a paper was submitted to the Seabird Bycatch Working Group meeting of ACAP in April
                        2010. Part "c" above was completed in January 2010 and has morphed into a second trial that may show more promise that the
                        first. When that trial has been completed the work will be written up for publication.
                        
                        Taken from the 2010/2011 Progress Report:
                        
                        Public summary of the season progress:
                        Line weighting trials: A trial was completed on the effects of seabird friendly (fast sinking) tuna branch lines on the catch
                        rates of target and non-target fish. No effects on catch rates were detected, clearing the way for test on effectivenes in
                        deterring seabirds. Out of this trial grew a second study, involving weights placed at the hook. This trial probably has more
                        promise than the first, and is currently underway in the Australian tuna fishery.
                        
                        Underwater setter: A prototype version was tested experimentally off Uruguay in the spring of 2010. The experiment revealed
                        the potential of underwater setting to near-eliminate seabird interactions. We are currenly finessing the technology with
                        a view to returning to Uruguay (with the finished product) in autumn 2012 to complete the experiment.

                        The experiment tested 52 combinations of swivel weight, bait type and bottom length. During the experiment practical constraints
                        meant that data were not always collected in a logical series.  The data are good, but is not easy to interpret without talking
                        to those that undertook the experiment.
                        
                        The values provided in spatial coverage are approximate only.
