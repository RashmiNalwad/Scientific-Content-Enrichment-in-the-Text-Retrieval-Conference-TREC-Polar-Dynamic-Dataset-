                            AM06 borehole drilled January 2010. 
 
 Data being collected at annual re-visits to site. 
 
 Consult Readme file for detail of data files and formats. A word document providing further information is also available as part of the download. 
 
 All of the .dat files of data can be viewed with a text editor such as Wordpad. 
 
 2012-2013 data may be final data from the unit owing to battery failure. 
 
 The original project for this dataset was ASAC 1164, but recent data fall under the auspices of project AAS 4096.
