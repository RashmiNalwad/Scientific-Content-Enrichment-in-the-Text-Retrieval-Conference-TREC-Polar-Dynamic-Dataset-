    Summary

    
    

    
    	

    
        
            Abstract: 
            During 2002-2003, water samples were collected from 22 streams, the hyporeic
      zone was sampled in 3 streams and water column profiles were collected for 4
      dry valley lakes (12 profiles).  Soil samples were also collected.
      
      For these samples, uranium series isotope analyses were performed.  This
      included uranium isotope ratios (U234/U238), Po210, Rn222 and Ra228/228
      isotopes.  A mass balance of U series isotopes was done from source to sinks.
      
      The findings of this research has important implications about the weathering
      processes in dry, wet environment.  Specifically, chemical weathering occurs at
      rates comparable to many temperate environments despite current arguments that
      higher temperatures and moisture are needed.  The intimate interrelationship
      between physical and chemical weathering is key to understanding this
      phenomena.
      
      This research was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No.
