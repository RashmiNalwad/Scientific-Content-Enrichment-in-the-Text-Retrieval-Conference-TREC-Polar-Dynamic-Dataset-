        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Air temperature observations were carried out in Riscos Rink, James Ross Island 
 during 1995 and 1996. Mean annual air temperature, and freezing and thawing 
 indices in 1996 were -6.8 degrees C, 274 and 240 degrees C days, respectively. 
 There are more than 100 freeze-thaw days in a year. These conditions favor the 
 development of some kinds of periglacial landforms. The climatic 
 geomorphologic characteristics of James Ross Island are discussed based on 
 freezing and thawing indexes. 
 
 This study was carried out within a Joint Research Program of the 
 Instituto Antartico Argentino and the Institute of Low Temperature 
 Science, with the logistic support of the DNA and the Fuerza Aerea 
 Argentina.
