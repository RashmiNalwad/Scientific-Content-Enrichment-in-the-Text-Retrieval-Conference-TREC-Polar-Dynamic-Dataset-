                            Abstract: 
                            Optical observations of auroral displays are performed by a camera with a field 
 of view of 180 degrees: the all-sky camera. A prototype camera has been 
 delivered to the Argentinian base General Belgrano II.The present instrument 
 has been equipped with a 512x382 CCD and a filter wheel housing three filters 
 in order to provide spectral discrimination at 630.0 nm, 557.7 nm and 427.8 nm. 
 The instrument is capable of acquiring an image in about one minute and an 
 half. The camera is operational during the entire antarctic winter and images 
 are taken when the solar terminator is above 300 km. The data will be 
 transmitted to Italy at the end of the observational campaign and collected in 
 the data center.
