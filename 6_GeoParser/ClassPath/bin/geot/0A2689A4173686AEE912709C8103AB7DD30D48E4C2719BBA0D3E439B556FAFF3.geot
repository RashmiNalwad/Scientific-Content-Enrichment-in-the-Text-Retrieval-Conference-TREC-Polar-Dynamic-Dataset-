M-flares are not the most powerful flares the Sun can emit, but sometimes even they can exhibit visually exciting behavior.

Here we show the lead-up to an M-flare which lauches a large amount of plasma into space.  The eruption takes place starting around 12:00 UTC and launches over the next 15 minutes.  But stay with it, and you'll also see some of the plasma falling back towards the Sun around 13:50 UTC.
