                            Abstract: 
                            MISR Level 1A (MI1ANAV) Navigation Data include all spacecraft position, velocity, attitude and attitude rate data incorporated into MISR Level 1A Engineering Data packets. These data are read from the Command and Telemetry Bus during the period of one EOS-TERRA orbit. 
 
 The MISR instrument consists of nine pushbroom cameras which measure radiance in four spectral bands. Global coverage is achieved  ... in nine days. The cameras are arranged with one camera pointing toward the nadir, four cameras pointing forward and four cameras pointing aftward. It takes 7 minutes for all nine cameras to view the same surface location. The view angles relative to the surface reference ellipsoid, are 0, 26.1, 45.6, 60.0, and 70.5 degrees. The spectral band shapes are nominally Gaussian, centered at 443, 555, 670, and 865 nm.
