        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The orthophoto was created by Dr Arko Lucieer of TerraLuma (http://www.terraluma.net/) and the University of Tasmania for the Terrestrial and Nearshore Ecosystems research group at the Australian Antarctic Division (TNE/AAD). 
 A Digital Surface Model (DSM) was also created. See the metadata record 'Digital Surface Model of the biopiles and nearby area at Casey, derived from aerial photographs taken  ... with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), 10 February 2013' with ID 'casey_biopiles_DSM_2013'. 
 
 The products were requested for Australian Antarctic Science Project 4036: 
 Remediation of petroleum contaminants in the Antarctic and subantarctic. 
 The products were created from digital photos taken on the 10th February, 2013, with a Canon EOS 550D from a Mikrokopter Oktokopter piloted by Arko Lucieer and Zybnek Malenovsky. 
 The products were georeferenced to ground control points surveyed using differential GPS by Dr Daniel Wilkins of TNE/AAD. 
 Raw photo metadata: ISO-400, Focal Length 20mm, f/6.3 Exposure Time 1/1250 sec. 
 Horizontal Datum: ITRF2000. 
 
 A version of the orthophoto resulting from the georeferencing of the orthophoto to the WGS84 horizontal datum of the Australian Antarctic Data Centre's Casey GIS dataset was subsequently created. This was done by the Australian Antarctic Data Centre. See the metadata record 'Digital Surface Model of the biopiles and nearby area at Casey, derived from aerial photographs taken with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), 10 February 2013 - WGS84' with ID 'casey_biopiles_DSM_2013_wgs84'.

            Processing to create the orthophoto and DSM 
 ------------------------------------------- 
 The algorithms used to generate 3D data from overlapping photographs is called Structure-from-Motion (SfM). More information about the theory and background can be found in 'Using An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (Uav) To Capture Micro-Topography Of Antarctic Moss Beds' by Arko Lucieer, Darren Turner,  ... Diana H. King, Sharon A. Robinson in the International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation 27 (2014) 53 -62.

 268 photographs acquired by the OktoKopter were processed with Agisoft Photoscan Professional v0.9. The Photoscan workflow is as follows: 
 1. Key image features automatically identified in all photos 2. Image features matched between photos to identify overlap and correspondence 3. Bundle adjustment performed to identify the position and orientation of the camera stations and the 3D coordinates of the image features 4. Generation of dense 3D point cloud and triangulated model from the sparse point cloud (output from step 3) 5. Identification of ground control points (GCPs) to transform the 3D model into an accurate real-world coordinate system 6. Generation of orthophoto mosaic and digital surface model (DSM) from 3D model and individual photographs 7. Orthophoto generated at 1 cm ground resolution and DSM generated at 2 cm resolution 
 
 The error in the transformation was ~14 cm. 
 
 The ground control points were collected with Trimble ProXH differential GPS with typically 30 seconds on each point, at 1 second sample rate). 
 The accuracy of the ground control points is estimated to be 10 to 20 cm.
