				Data Center Description
				

				   
					
						http://www.csc.noaa.gov 
 The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) 
 Coastal Services Center (CSC) is a coastal science and resource 
 advisory center that draws on the expertise of NOAA and its partners 
 to address critical coastal resource issues. Established in 1994 in 
 Charleston, South Carolina, the Center's mission is to identify, 
 develop, and facilitate the use of technologies and information that 
 support use and management of coastal resources. The Center will 
 serve to "bridge the gap" between coastal scientists and resource 
 managers by bringing Center staff, technologies, and outside partner 
 expertise to bear on national problems related to coastal ecosystems 
 and economies.
