                            Abstract: 
                            Ambient air quality monitoring is important in Denali, to document baseline 
 conditions and to track long term trends. 
 
 Denali National Park and Preserve is the only National Park in Alaska 
 designated as class I under the Clean Air Act. 
 
 Geographic Description: 
 Specific coordinates in the Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska. 
 Denali National Park and Preserve is located in the central  ... Alaska Range, 
 approximately 210 km southwest of Fairbanks, Alaska. 
 
 Methodology: 
 Denali currently participates in three nationwide air quality monitoring 
 networks: National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP), Interagency 
 Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE), National Park Service 
 Gaseous Pollutant Monitoring Network (ozone monitoring). Air quality 
 monitoring protocols have been written for each network, and approved by the 
 respective network steering committees. Since there is no local control over 
 methodology, the network manuals are the park's guiding documents. This is a 
 compilation of network protocols.
