        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Ship observations, collected over the period 1980 - 2004, will be used to determine the regional and seasonal variability of the Antarctic sea ice thickness distribution. The thickness of Antarctic sea ice is not well understood, and cannot be determined from remote sensing, yet it plays an integral role in the climate system and is climatically sensitive. This project aims to establish a baseline of sea ice thickness using data compiled from many different countries, which is required by scientists across many disciplines. 
 
 This is a parent record for the project. For details on individual cruises, see the child records.
