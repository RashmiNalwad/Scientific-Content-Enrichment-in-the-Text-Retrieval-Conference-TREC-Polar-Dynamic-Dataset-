        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost (GTN-P) was initiated by 
 the International Permafrost Association (IPA) to organize and manage 
 a global network of permafrost observatories for detecting, 
 monitoring, and predicting climate change. The network, authorized 
 under  ... the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) and its associated 
 organizations, consists of two observational components: the active 
 layer (the surface layer that freezes and thaws annually) and the 
 thermal state of the underlying permafrost. 
 
 This web site provides general information on the GTN-P and details of 
 the permafrost thermal monitoring component. The second component of 
 the GTN-P is the ongoing Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) 
 network which was established in 1990 to monitor changes in active 
 layer thickness and temperature. Further information on the CALM 
 component can be found on the CALM web site. The European Community 
 project, Permafrost and Climate in Europe (PACE), contributes to the 
 GTN-P and plans to monitor nine boreholes in mountain permafrost. 
 
 Inventory Data of the candidate boreholes is kept by GTN-P for 
 Antartica, Argentina, China, Canada, Greenland, Italy, Kazakstan, 
 Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and 
 the United States.
