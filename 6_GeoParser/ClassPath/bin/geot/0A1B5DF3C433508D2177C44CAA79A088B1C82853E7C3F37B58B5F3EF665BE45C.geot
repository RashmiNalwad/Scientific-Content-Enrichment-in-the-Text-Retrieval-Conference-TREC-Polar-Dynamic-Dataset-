        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The response of El Nino to natural radiative forcing changes over the 
 past 1000 yr is investigated based on numerical experiments employing the 
 Zebiak-Cane model of the tropical Pacific coupled ocean-atmosphere system. 
 Previously published empirical results demonstrating a statistically 
 significant tendency toward El Nino conditions in response to past volcanic 
 radiative forcing are  ... reproduced in the model experiments. A combination of 
 responses to past changes in volcanic and solar radiative forcing closely 
 reproduces changes in the mean state and interannual variability in El Nino 
 in past centuries recorded from fossil corals. The dynamics of El Nino thus 
 appear to have played an important role in the response of the global climate 
 to past changes in radiative forcing. 
 
 This dataset contains volcanic and solar forcing of the Tropical Pacific over 
 the past 1000 years. Data include the tropical solar and volcanic radiative 
 forcing series from AD 1000-1999 (as shown in Figure 1) used in the 
 simulations. 
 
 For each of these 3 files, the first column is year (AD), the 2nd column the 
 model result (Nino-3 index, anomalies in degrees C), and the 3rd and 4th 
 columns represent the lower and upper interfourth quartiles from the ensembles 
 (as described in text).
