			  ABOUT THE MISSION

							  
				
			  

			
			
			  
				The Deep Space Atomic Clock, or DSAC, is a technology demonstration of a small, ultra-precise, mercury-ion atomic clock, which will be launched into Earth orbit to test its potential as a next-generation tool for spacecraft navigation, radio science and global positioning systems. The technology, which is designed to improve navigation of spacecraft to distant destinations and enable collection of more data with better precision, is 50 times more accurate than today's best navigation clocks.



The project is scheduled for a 2016 launch aboard a hosted payload built in partnership with NASA's Space Communications and Navigation Program and the Department of Defense.
