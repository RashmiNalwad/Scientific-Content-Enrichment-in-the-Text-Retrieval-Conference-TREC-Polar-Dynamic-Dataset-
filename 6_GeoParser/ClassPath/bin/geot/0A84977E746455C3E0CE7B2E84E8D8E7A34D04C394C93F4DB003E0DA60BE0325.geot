Description


    Jason maps ocean surface topography. The data collected 
 provide information on ocean surface current velocity and 
 heights which, when combined with ocean models, can 
 lead to a four-dimensional  ... description of ocean circulation. 
 Data from Jason are also extending ocean surface 
 topography into the 21st century, providing a 5-year view 
 of global ocean surface topography, increasing understanding 
 of ocean circulation, improving forecasting of 
 climate events, and measuring global sea-level change.
