                            Cariaco Basin 50KYr Radiocarbon Calibration and Reconstruction. 
 Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) 14C data from planktonic 
 foraminifera from Ocean Drilling Program Site 1002, cores 1002D and 
 1002E, Cariaco Basin (10 deg. 42.73'N, 65 deg. 10.18'W, 893m. depth) 
 
 ABSTRACT (from the online documentation): 
 A series of 14C measurements in Ocean Drilling Program  ... cores from the 
 tropical Cariaco Basin, which have been correlated to the annual-layer 
 counted chronology for the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) ice 
 core, provides a high-resolution calibration of the radiocarbon time 
 scale back to 50,000 years before the present. Independent radiometric 
 dating of events correlated to GISP2 suggests that the calibration is 
 accurate. Reconstructed 14C activities varied substantially during 
 the last glacial period, including sharp peaks synchronous with the 
 Laschamp and Mono Lake geomagnetic field intensity minimal and 
 cosmogenic nuclide peaks in ice cores and marine 
 sediments. Simulations with a geochemical box model suggest that much 
 of the variability can be explained by geomagnetically modulated 
 changes in 14C production rate together with plausible changes in 
 deep-ocean ventilation and the global carbon cycle during glaciation.
