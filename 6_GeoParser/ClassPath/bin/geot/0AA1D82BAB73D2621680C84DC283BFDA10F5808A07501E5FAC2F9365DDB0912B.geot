                    Service Provider Description

                    
                        
                            Aviso distributes satellite altimetry data from Topex/Poseidon, Jason-1, ERS-1 and ERS-2, and EnviSat, and Doris precise orbit determination and positioning products. 

 

 These data are used to study ocean dynamics and geophysics in many applications, including climate prediction, monitoring of mean sea level, global warming, El Ni?o and La Ni?a events, marine currents and ocean circulation, and tide, wind, wave and marine meteorology models. 

 

 When delivered in near-real time, these data form the basis for operational oceanography-in other words, ocean monitoring and prediction, particularly within the framework of the Godae program and the Mercator project.
