                Definition:

                
                    Blue-Green Algae, now called cyanobacteria, are good examples
of photoautotrophic eubacteria.  They are also among the most
common photoautotrophs on Earth.  Most live in ponds and other freshwater
habitats.  They may grow as mucus-sheathed chains of cells, which can form
dense, slimy mats near the surface of nutrient-enriched water.
