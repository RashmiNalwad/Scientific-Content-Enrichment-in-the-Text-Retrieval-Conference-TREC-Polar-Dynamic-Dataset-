        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            This dataset consists of radiocarbon dates of ancient algae from former ice-dammed ponds along Shackleton Glacier.     
                        

                    
                    
                        
                            

                            Purpose: 
                            These data relate to past changes in ice level.
