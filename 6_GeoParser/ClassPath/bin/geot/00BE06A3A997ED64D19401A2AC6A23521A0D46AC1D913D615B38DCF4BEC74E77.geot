                            Abstract: 
                            This dataset contains gridded sea-level pressure data that covers the area around New Zealand. The grid is a 16x16 grid over the area from 5S to 80S and 60E to 150W, with a resolution of five degrees in latitude and ten degrees in longitude. For the period from June 1957 to February 1958, the sea-level pressures were extracted from the 00Z meteorological charts.
