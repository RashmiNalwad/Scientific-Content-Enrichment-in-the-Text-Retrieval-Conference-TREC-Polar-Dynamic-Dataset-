                            Abstract: 
                            The GPM Ground Validation NEXRAD MC3E datasets were collected from six radar sites from April 22, 2011 to June 6, 2011 for the Midlatitude Continental Convective Clouds Experiment (MC3E) which took place in central Oklahoma. Radar sites include KGLD, KICT, KINX, KTLX, KTWX, KVNX. The Next Generation Weather Radar system (NEXRAD) comprises 159 Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) sites throughout the United States and select overseas locations. The GPM Ground Validation NEXRAD MC3E data files are available as tarred binary files.
