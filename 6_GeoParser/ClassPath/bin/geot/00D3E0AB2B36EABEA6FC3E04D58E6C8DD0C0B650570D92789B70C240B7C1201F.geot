                            Abstract: 
                            This data set contains soil temperature, soil moisture, thaw depth, and snow depth data collected at test sites near Barrow, Alaska, during the following years. Soil temperature data - 1963-1966, 1993 Soil moisture data - 1963 Thaw depth - 1962-1968, 1991-1993 Snow depth - 1963-1964 This study focused on characterizing the active soil layer at Barrow, and determining the relationships between and among these physical properties at permafrost sites in the Arctic. This site is U1 of the IPA's Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) Program and later measurements are available at the CALM Web site.
