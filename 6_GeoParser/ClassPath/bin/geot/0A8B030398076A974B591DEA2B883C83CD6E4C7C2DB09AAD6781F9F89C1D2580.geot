                            Abstract: 
                            Metadata record for data expected from ASAC Project 2767 See the link below for public details on this project. 
 
 A multidisciplinary survey of the processes linking sea ice with biological elements of Antarctic marine ecosystems was conducted in winter 2007. The survey provided large-scale information on sea ice biological and physical parameters in the 100-130 degree East sector off East  ... Antarctica. The distribution of sea ice algae and krill were measured using various methods including ice coring surveys and trawls. These measurements were complemented by shipborne measurements and an intensive sea ice sampling program. Use of an ROV was attempted but did not result in quantitative/geo-referenced data. Under-ice video files are available from the Chief-Investigator. 
 
 Individual word documents are available from this metadata record for each ice station. These contain information on the ice station number, date and time of record and the parameters/ samples.
