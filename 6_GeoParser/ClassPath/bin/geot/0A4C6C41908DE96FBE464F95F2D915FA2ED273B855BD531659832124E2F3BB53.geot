                Definition:

                
                    Albedo is the ratio of the radiation (radiant energy or luminous
energy) reflected by a surface to that incident on it. Snow and cloud
surfaces have a high albedo, because most of the energy of the visible
solar spectrum is reflected. Vegetation and ocean surfaces have low
albedo, because they absorb a large fraction of the energy. Clouds are the
chief cause of variations in the Earth's albedo.
