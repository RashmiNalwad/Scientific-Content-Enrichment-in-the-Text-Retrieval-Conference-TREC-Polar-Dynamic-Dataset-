                            Abstract: 
                            The i-Tree suite of software tools was developed to help users regardless of community size or technical capacity identify, understand and manage urban tree populations. Better awareness of the benefits and services provided by the urban forest resource leads to increased attention to stewardship, appreciation of operations, and investment in maintenance. 
 
 i-Tree v2.0 features new tools, updated applications, streamlined installation and set up, enhanced reporting features and improved overall functionality.

                                Within i-Tree, entire urban forest tree populations are assessed using Eco-originally the Urban Forest Effects (UFORE1) model. Eco is a software application designed to use field data from complete inventories or randomly located plots throughout a community along with local hourly air pollution and meteorological data to quantify urban forest structure, environmental effects, and value to communities. Baseline data can be used for making effective resource management decisions, develop policy and set priorities.

                                Description: 
                                Within i-Tree, street tree populations are assessed using Streets (formerly STRATUM). Streets is a street tree management and analysis tool for urban forest managers that uses tree inventory data to quantify the dollar value of annual environmental and aesthetic benefits: energy conservation, air quality improvement, CO2 reduction, stormwater control, and property value increase.
 
 It's an easy-to-use, computer-based program that allows any community to conduct and analyze a street tree inventory. Baseline data can be used to effectively manage the resource, develop policy and set priorities. Using a sample or an existing inventory of street trees, this software allows managers to evaluate current benefits, costs, and management needs.
