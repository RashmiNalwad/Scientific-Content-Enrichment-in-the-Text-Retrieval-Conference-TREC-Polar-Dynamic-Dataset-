                            Abstract: 
                            From the abstract of the referenced papers: 
 
 The northern Prince Charles Mountains overlook the western side of the 700km long Lambert Glacier-Amery Ice Shelf drainage system. Within these mountains, at Amery Oasis and Fisher Massif, the Cenozoic glaciomarine Pagodroma Group consists of four uplifted Miocene and Pliocene-early Pleistocene formations here named the Mount Johnston, Fisher Bench,  ... Battye Glacier and Bardin Bluffs formations. These are composed of massive and stratified diamicts, boulder gravels and minor laminated sandstones, siltstones and mudstones. Each formation rests on either Precambrian metamorphic rocks, or on Permo-Triassic fluvial strata. The unconformity surfaces are parts of the walls and floors of palaeofjords. The Miocene Fisher Bench Formation exceeds 350 m in thickness at Fisher Massif, where the yet older Miocene (or Oligocene) Mount Johnston Formation overlies basement rocks at up to 1400 m above sea level. Individual formations contain either Miocene diatoms, or else Pliocene-early Pleistocene diatom foram assemblages. The diamicts are interpreted as fjordal ice-proximal or ice-contact sediments, deposited seawards of tidewater glacier fronts located some 250 to 300 km inland of the present ocean margin. Each formation records an ice recession following a glacial expansion. 
 
 This work was also completed for ASAC project 2086 (ASAC_2086). 
 
 Some explanatory notes for the excel files are: 
 
 BARDIN = Bardin Bluffs 
 GLOSS. = Glossopteris Gully 
 BAIN= Bainmedart Cove 
 PCM = Prince Charles Mountains 
 AM = Amery (as in Amery Oasis) 
 
 Sample numbers are from different positions within exposed sequences (illustrated in figures in the paper). Top and Bottom represent the 'top' and 'bottom' position in some sequences. These are also illustrated in the figures. 
 
 Positions are illustrated in the manuscript Whitehead, et al (2004). 
 
 Dm = diamict sample, Mud = Mud. 
 
 Raw slides = standard strewn microscope slides 
 Concentrated slides = heavy liquid separation to concentrate the fossils
