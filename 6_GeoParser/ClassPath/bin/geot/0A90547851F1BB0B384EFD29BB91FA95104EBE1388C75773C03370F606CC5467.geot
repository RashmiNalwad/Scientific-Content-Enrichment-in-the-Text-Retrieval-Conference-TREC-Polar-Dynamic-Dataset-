  The History and Discovery of Asteroids

  
  Learners will explore scientific discoveries and the technologies as a sequence of events that led eventually to the Dawn mission. This standards-aligned module is organized around a learning cycle and engages students in a number of experience in order for the teacher to activate students' prior knowledge, assess student conceptual understanding in order to inform instruction.

  
  Many of the MS Word documents below are password-protected. This means that there are special restrictions in effect. However, a student can type in the document and save their work electronically in the areas that show gold brackets []. A password is not needed to open, type in the gold brackets, or save the document.  The document will continue to be password-protected in the restricted areas after being saved with the student's work.

    Where the Journey Began

    Eight short reading trace the history of asteroid discovery and characterization from the time of Ptolemy (85-150 AD) to the present time. Each student group is responsible for one reading.

    Modeling Asteroids

    Contains hands-on activities that can be used to help students understand what astronomers in the historical readings of the Exploration Section were experiencing as they studied asteroids from Earth.

    Students communicate and synthesize what they have learned about the interrelatedness of science, technology, and relevant historical/political events.

    
    
      Assessment

       Teacher Guide (PDF)

    
    
    
    Mystery Asteroid

    Students apply their new knowledge and skills by making observations, inferences, and conclusions about a "mystery asteroid."

    The assessment provides students with a Hubble Space Telescope picture of this "mystery asteroid," and then later presents some facts. Teachers can use students' responses to the assessment questions to evaluate their understanding of the module content.
