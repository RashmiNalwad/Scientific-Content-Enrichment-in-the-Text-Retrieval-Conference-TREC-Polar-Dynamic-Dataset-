        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Sediment Recruitment Experiment 4 (SRE4) was a large, long term (5 year) field experiment run at Casey Station (from 2001 to 2006) testing the effects of 4 different hydrocarbons on marine sediment ecosystems. Four different types of hydrocarbons were individually mixed with defaunated marine sediments and deployed in trays on the seabed at O'Brien Bay-1. Trays were collected after deployment  ... periods of 5 weeks, 56 weeks, 62 weeks, 2 years and 5 years. In addition there was a bioturbation treatment using the burrowing urchin Abatus (at 56 weeks only). Samples were collected from 4 replicate trays of each treatment at each sampling time. Analyses were done of sediment hydrocarbon chemistry, microbial communities, meiofaunal communities, macrofaunal communities and diatom communities. The hydrocarbon treatments were: a synthetic Mobil lubricating oil; the same Mobil lubricating oil after 125? hours use in a vehicle engine; a Fuchs synthetic lubricating oil marketed as highly biodegradable; and Special Antarctic Blend diesel fuel (SAB). A control uncontaminated sediment treatment was used for comparison. 
    
                        

                    
                    
                        
                            

                            Purpose: 
                            To determine the effects of hydrocarbons on marine sediment meiofaunal communities in Antarctica. 
 
 This is the dataset for meiofaunal communities in sediments in the experiment at Time 4 (2 years after deployment). 
 
 Only 2 replicates per tray (of each treatment) have been analysed. 2 replicates of each tray remain unsorted.
