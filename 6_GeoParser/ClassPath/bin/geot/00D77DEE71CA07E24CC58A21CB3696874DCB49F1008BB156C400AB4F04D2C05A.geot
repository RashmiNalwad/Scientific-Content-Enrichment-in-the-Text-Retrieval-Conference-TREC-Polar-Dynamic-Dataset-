        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The Urban Place Time-Series Population of Mexico contains population counts for more than 700 urban centers every 10 years from 1921 through 1990. The urban centers include metropolitan, conurbation, and city areas with more than 5,000 inhabitants as of 1980. This data set is produced by the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN). 
 
 The data in Microsoft Excel (XLS) and Comma Separated Value (CSV) formats are available from the NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC).     
                        

                    
                    
                        
                            

                            Purpose: 
                            To provide time-series population data for Mexico for conducting assessments of human interactions with the environment.
