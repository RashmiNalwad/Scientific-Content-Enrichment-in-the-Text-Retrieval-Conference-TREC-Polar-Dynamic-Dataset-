                            Abstract: 
                            Oceanographic measurements were conducted along WOCE Southern Ocean meridional section SR3 between Tasmania and Antarctica, and along the part of WOCE Southern ocean zonal section S4 lying between approximately 110 and 162 deg.E, from December 1994 to February 1995. An array of 4 current meter moorings at approximately 51 deg.S in the vicinity of the SR3 line was successfully recovered. A total of  ... 107 CTD vertical profile stations were taken, most to near bottom. Over 2380 Niskin bottle water samples were collected for the measurement of salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients (phosphate, nitrate+nitrite, silicate), chlorofluorocarbons, helium, tritium, dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity, carbon isotopes, dissolved organic carbon, dimethyl sulphide/dimethyl sulphoniopropionate, iodate/iodide, oxygen 18, primary productivity, and biological parameters, using a 24 bottle rosette sampler. Measurement and data processing techniques are described, and a summary of the data are presented in graphical and tabular form.
