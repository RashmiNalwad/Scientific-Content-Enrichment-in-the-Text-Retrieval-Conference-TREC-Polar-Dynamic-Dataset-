Do your part… today is No Drive-Thru Thursday.  Take time to think about how you contribute to air pollution and how you could lesson that contribution.  Avoid the drive-thru and go inside to order your food, coffee or prescriptions. By doing this you will reduce exhaust emissions.

NASA is also working hard to understand our air quality here on Earth! For example, the Chemistry and Physics Atmospheric Boundary Layer Experiment (CAPABLE) is a ground-based observation site created in 2009 that is dedicated to studying atmospheric conditions in the Tidewater region of Virginia. The site, which is located at NASA’s Langley Research Center, is a collaborative effort between the Science Directorate at NASA Langley, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality. Together, these partners operate a suite of instrumentation designed to track and observe pollutants in the Earth’s troposphere. You can look at the real time data and learn about the instruments used for air quality measurements on the CAPABLE website, at: http://capable.larc.nasa.gov/.

Check back with Observe Your World tomorrow to find out the next “Do your part” challenge and learn about a new NASA air quality mission or project.
