        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The data sets consist of static GPS data collected on the Amery Ice Shelf using Leica CRS1000 receivers. Additional data at Landing Bluff, Dalton Corner and Beaver Lake were collected by ANU (see ASAC project 1112). All data are provided in UNIX Z compressed RINEX (Receiver INdependent EXchange) format, as described in the IGS standards - see http://igscb.jpl.nasa.gov/components/data.html 
 
 The  ... standard RINEX file naming convention is used, i.e., an eight digit file name as bbbbddds.yyt, where bbbb refers to a four digit station name, ddd refers to the day number of the year, s refers to a session number and yyt is the file extension number where yy refers to the year and t defines the file type (o for observation file and n for navigation file). All files are compressed using the UNIX Z compression scheme, as shown by the extension .Z. For example, base0010.00o.Z and base0010.00n.Z. 
 
 The files are set out in the following directories on the ftp site: 
 season1999_2000 
 \amery 
 \land 
 \raw 
 
 Data are also available for download from the Australian Antarctic Data Centre at the URL given below. 
 
 Raw data, where available, is stored in the aw directory in standard Leica LB2 Binary format. Conversion routines are available: 
 http://facility.unavco.org/software/teqc/teqc.html 
 
 GPS data collected at the permanent stations at Casey, Davis and Mawson are available from Geoscience Australia (previously AUSLIG) - see http://www.ga.gov.au/geodesy/antarc/antgps.jsp
