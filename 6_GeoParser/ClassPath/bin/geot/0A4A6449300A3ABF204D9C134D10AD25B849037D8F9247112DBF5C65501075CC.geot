    Summary


    

    
    	

    
        
            Abstract: 
            This data set includes isotope and depth age data, and CO2 and CH4 data from the Dome C Antarctica ice core. This core is a 906 meter core that spans approximately 32,000 years. It was a thermally drilled core and was retrieved during the 1977-78 Antarctic field season as part of the International Antarctic Glaciological project.
