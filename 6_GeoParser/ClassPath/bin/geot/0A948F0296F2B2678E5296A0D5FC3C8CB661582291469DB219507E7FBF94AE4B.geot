        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The Mineral Resources Data System (MRDS) data base, formerly known as the Computerized Resources Information Bank (CRIB), was developed by Dr. James A. Calkins and implemented by the U.S. Geological Survey in 1972. The MRDS compact disc-read only memory (CD-ROM) was developed from the MRDS data base to store, organize, and retrieve large amounts of data about mineral deposit sites, including  ... mines, prospects, and occurrences. The MRDS data base became a reference tool for Federal, State, and nongovernment scientists wanting location and descriptive geologic information about mineral deposits. 
 
 The MRDS data base is continuously updated with new information, and records are modified when applicable. An updated MRDS CD-ROM is issued periodically (i.e., no set schedule) with updated MRDS data base information. Currently, the MRDS CD-ROM contains a data base with 111,955 variable-length records of metallic and nonmetallic worldwide mineral resources (i.e., district and regional sites that were known) as of September 1, 1995. Each data base record contains descriptive information that includes deposit name, location, commodity, deposit description, geologic characteristics, production, reserves, potential resources, and references.
