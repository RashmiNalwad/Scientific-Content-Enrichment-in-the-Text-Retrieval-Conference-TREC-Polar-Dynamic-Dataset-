        Summary


        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The HAZUS-MH earthquake model estimates damage and loss to buildings, lifelines and essential facilities from scenario and probabilistic earthquakes, including: 
 
 1. Ground shaking and ground failure 
 2. Estimates of casualties 
 3. Displaced households and shelter requirements 
 4. Damage and loss of use of essential facilities 
 5. Estimated cost of repairing damaged buildings 
 6. Quantity of debris 
 7. Damage to buildings 
 8. Direct costs associated with loss of function (e.g., loss of business revenue)
