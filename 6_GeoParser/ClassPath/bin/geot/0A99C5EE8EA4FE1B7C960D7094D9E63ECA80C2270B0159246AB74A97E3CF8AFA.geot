        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The Guide to Social Science Applications of Remote Sensing provides an introduction to remote sensing to non-specialists and social scientists. It highlights the advantages of remotely sensed data for social science research, and some of the key methodological concerns when integrating remote sensing with socioeconomic data. It summarizes the methodology and results of research using remote  ... sensing in demography, human health, epidemiology, archeology, anthropology, internal relations, law, policy, land-use, land cover change and urban studies. A table listing the technical specifications of various remote sensing instruments, along with the geophysical quantities and processes that can be detected is provided. References and related resources are also provided for each chapter. The guide is produced by Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).
