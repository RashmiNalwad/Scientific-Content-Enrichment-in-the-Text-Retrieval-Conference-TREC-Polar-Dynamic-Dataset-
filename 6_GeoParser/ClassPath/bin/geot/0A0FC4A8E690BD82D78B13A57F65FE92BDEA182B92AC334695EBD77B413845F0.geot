        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The TOGA COARE Data Information System distributes all TOGA COARE 
 information. 
 
 WWW: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/coare/ 
 FTP: ftp://tcdm.coare.ucar.edu/ 
 
 Dropsonde data are available from the UCAR/JOSS CODIAC system through 
 the WWW (World Wide Web)/CODIAC interface at 
  ... http://www.joss.ucar.edu/ 
 
 TOGA COARE was a multidisciplinary, international research effort that 
 investigated the scientific phenomena associated with the interaction 
 between the atmosphere and the ocean in the warm pool region of the 
 western Pacific. The field experiment phase of the program took place 
 from 1 November 1992 through 28 February 1993 and involved the 
 deployment of oceanographic ships and buoys, several ship and land 
 based Doppler radars, multiple low and high level aircraft equipped 
 with Doppler radar and other airborne sensors, as well as a variety of 
 surface based instruments for in situ observations. 
 
 Two LOD2 dropsonde data systems each were installed on the NASA DC8 
 and on one of the NOAA P3s. Overall 110 LOD2 (Omega) dropsondes were 
 deployed during TOGA COARE, 30 dropsondes from the NOAA P3 and 80 from 
 the NASA DC8. 
 
 The NCAR Lightweight Omega Digital Dropsonde (LOD2) contains an Omega 
 receiver, a 400 MHz transmitter and a microprocesser which processes 
 and formats thermodynamic data from sensors for transmission to the 
 aircraft. The aircraft portion of the dropwindsonde system consists 
 of a 400 MHz telemetry receiver, a thermodynamic data processor, an 
 onboard 486 PC, and a Trimble Mini Omega (TMO) Model 8402 navigator. 
 
 The dropwindsonde system measures thermodynamic parameters (pressure, 
 temperature, humidity), horizontal wind, and position. 
 
 An Omega sounding initiated from an altitude of 40,000 ft (12.2 km) 
 typically takes about 35 to 27 minutes before it splashes into the 
 ocean and ceases transmission. Nominal sonde descent velocities are 
 about 12 to 13 m/sec at high altitude and 5 to 6 m/sec at the surface. 
 In TOGA COARE, the drop rate was usually irregular.

 For each individual drop, three different ASCII files were produced. Each 
 file has a header section identifying the data file type as 
 "raw thermodynamic data", "ten-second" data and "interpolated data". 
 The header section also provides information regarding the particular 
 drop and its processing. 
 
 For a detailed description of the instrument, the data, etc., request 
 the hard-copy report "TOGA COARE Dropsonde Data Report", from the TOGA 
 COARE International Project Office.
