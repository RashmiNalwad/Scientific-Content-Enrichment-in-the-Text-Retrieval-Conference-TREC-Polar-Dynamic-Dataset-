    Summary

    
    

    
    	

    
        
            Abstract: 
            The Minnesota Geographic Data Clearinghouse (MGDC) serves as a convenient source for geographic data, ranging from simple state maps to complex geospatial data needed to power Geographic Information Systems.

Coordinated by MnGeo, the MGDC provides access to a wide variety of sources making it your "First Stop" for geographic data for Minnesota. MGDC partners include the USGS, Bureau of the Census, Minnesota's DNR, DOT and PCA, the MetroGIS program and many others.

The GeoGateway lets you customize your search in four different areas:
1. Nodes: Simultaneously search one or more data sources from around the state, region and country.
2. Keywords: Enter up to four keywords or phrases to specify the type of data desired.
3. Location (optional): Identify the geographic area you are interested in by selecting from the menus or drawing on a map.
4. Time Period (optional): Specify the time period for the data you want.

The GeoGateway search returns titles of data sets that match your selection criteria. Each title links you to a detailed description of the data, called metadata, which includes the most important facts about the data and information on how to obtain a copy. Data often can be downloaded directly through the metadata.
