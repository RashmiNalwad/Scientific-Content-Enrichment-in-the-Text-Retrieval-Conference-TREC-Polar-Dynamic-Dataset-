                            Abstract: 
                            CALINE4, CAlifornia LINE Source Dispersion Model, version 4, is the standard modeling program used by Caltrans to assess carbon monoxide impacts near transportation facilities, as described in Appendix B of the CO Protocol. It is based on the Gaussian diffusion equation and employs a mixing zone concept to characterize pollutant dispersion over the roadway. Predicts air concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), and suspended particles near roadways. Options are available for modeling near intersections, parking lots, elevated or depressed freeways, and canyons.

            This package includes Version 1.31 of "CL4",and requires Windows 95/NT or higher. CL4 is a user interface designed to work with the CO Protocol, and can only be used for CO analysis. Other uses of the CALINE4 model, while possible by use of the "CALINE4.EXE" MS-DOS program (included) as a command-line program without the user interface, is not supported by Caltrans. For use of CALINE4 without the CL4 user interface, consult the CALINE4 Manual (1989 research report), also available from the web site.
