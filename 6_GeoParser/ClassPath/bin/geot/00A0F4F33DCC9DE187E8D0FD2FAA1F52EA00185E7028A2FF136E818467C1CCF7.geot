Particulate impurities in snow such as dust and soot can absorb sunlight.  This is important for snow albedo in the Arctic, but probably not in the Antarctic.  Snow was collected in plastic bags through ...
	Parent metadata record for all metadata created from the SIPEX II voyage of the Aurora Australis, 2012-2013 season - Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem eXperiment
More than 50 scientists from eight countries conducted the Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem eXperiment 2012 (SIPEX-2). The 2012 voyage built on information and observations collected in 2007, by re-visiting ...
	Visible light radiometer data for the Broke-West Survey
Spectra of downwelling irradiance and upwelling, water-leaving radiance were measured continuously, as fast as light-levels would allow, during stations and whilst the ship was underway.  Data processing ...
	Remote Sensing Validation Experiment
At a spatial resolution of 25 km and offering complete daily coverage of Antarctica, the DMSP SSM/I is a key source of information on both sea-ice concentration and extent.  Data have been both acquired ...

	The glaciers, an observatory of climate, exploratory step for Kerguelen component - GLACIOCLIM-KESAACO (KErguelen Surface Ablation, Accumulation and Climate Observation)
This proposal is the exploratory step for Kerguelen component of the GLACIOCLIM Observatory. GLACIOCLIM is a French observatory to globally detect, monitor and understand climate and mass balance ...
	Ocean Surfaces on Snowball Earth
The climatic changes of the Neoproterozoic time, 600-800 million years ago, included episodes of extreme glaciation, during which ice may have covered nearly the entire ocean for several million years, ...
	RESURS-O1 data from Eurimage
Eurimage is bridging the gap between AVHRR's 1 km resolution and Landsat TM's
30 metres with data obtained from the RESURS-O1-3 satellite from Russia.
Launched in November 1994, this third satellite ...
	Collaborative Research in IPY: Abrupt Environmental Change in the Larsen Ice Shelf System, a Multidisciplinary Approach - Cryosphere and Oceans
This award supports the cryospheric and oceano-graphic components of an integrated multi-disciplinary program to address these rapid and fundamental changes now taking place in Antarctic Peninsula ...
	AVHRR Polar Pathfinder Twice-Daily 1.25 km EASE-Grid Composites
Please note that the machine on which these AVHRR data are processed has reached its life expectancy and will no longer be available as of 02 June 2008 until further notice. ...
	Light transfer measurements in the snow pack from FINNARP 2009 snow team
Data set contains light transfer measurements in Antarctic snow pack using visible-near infrared spectroradiometer and PAR sensors. These measurements were done during FINNARP 2009 expedition in December ...

	The hydrology (pattern of flow and composition of meltwater) of a cold based glacier, Wright Lower Glacier, Wright Valley, Antarctica
The seasonal melt regime of the Wright Lower Glacier, Wright Valley, Dry Valleys, Antarctica was investigated and monitored over three field seasons (04-05, 05-06 and 06-07). The water cycle, which ...
	Automatic weather station measurements for debris covered ice, bare ice and snow accumulation area over two summer season on the McMurdo Ice Shelf
An automatic weather station (AWS) was installed in three separate surface types in the vicinity of Bratina Island on the McMurdo Ice Shelf (MIS) over two summer seasons, in order to identify the ...
	Laboratory Studies of Photochemistry in Antarctic Snow and Ice
Our US NSF-funded project had two major parts: (1) measuring the quantum yields
            for photolysis of nitrite (NO2-), nitrous acid (HNO2), and hydrogen peroxide
            (HOOH) using laboratory ...
	State of the Cryosphere
The Cryospheric regions, or regions where water is found in solid
      form, are among the most sensitive to temperature change. Average
      temperatures in snow and ice-covered areas typically ...
