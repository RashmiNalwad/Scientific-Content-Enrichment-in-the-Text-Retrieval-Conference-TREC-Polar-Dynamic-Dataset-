        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Dissemination of data on environmental characteristics,using 
 innovative electronic (CD-ROM) data management: Tools for protection 
 of biodiversity in the endangered areas of the World's Tropical Ocean 
 
 The leading oceanographic institutes of Ukraine and Russia hold 
 extensive and very valuable information on the species diversity and 
 spatial-temporal variability  ... of physical, chemical and biological 
 characteristics from the World's Tropical Ocean. Up to now, this 
 information has been practically inaccessible to scientist outside the 
 Former Soviet Union (FSU). This project aims to make these data 
 available through the establishment of scientific links between 
 western Europe and FSU countries, which will enable the data to be 
 evaluated, jointly analysed and made available to the international 
 scientific community. In 1997, a joint research project was funded by 
 the International Associate for the Promotion of Co-operation with 
 Scientists from the Independent States of the FSU (INTAS) in the frame 
 of project UA952-80 with additional funding from the Dept. of 
 Environment and Transport (DETR)UK. 
 
 The evaluation and modern analysis of these data can fill the gap 
 of our knowledge on biovariability required for the macroscale and the 
 synoptic scale. The above data will form a basis to become combined 
 with those obtained by USA, UK and The Netherlands during recent 
 expeditions to the Indian Ocean. 
 
 The project involves the Institute of Biology of the Southern Seas, 
 Ukraine; Marine Hydrophysical Institute, Ukraine; Institute of 
 Oceanology, Russia; Expert Centre for Taxonomic Identification, 
 University of Amsterdam; Plymouth Marine Laboratory, UK. The project 
 involves the co-operation between the institutes to digitise the basic 
 oceanographic datasets and release them on CD-ROM, to be widely 
 available to scientists all over the world. 
 
 The data includes physical (temperature, salinity), Chemical 
 (dissolved oxygen, phosphate, nitrate, nitrite) and Biological 
 (Chlorophyll-a, primary productivity, Bacterioplankton, phytoplankton, 
 microzooplankton, mesozooplankton, micronekton and nekton)data. The 
 collected plankton and trawl samples were treated to the level of 
 genus and part of them to the species level. The sampling procedure 
 included the studies of vertical profiles, trawls, horizontal plankton 
 continuous records and net catches in mainly the upper 200m layer.
