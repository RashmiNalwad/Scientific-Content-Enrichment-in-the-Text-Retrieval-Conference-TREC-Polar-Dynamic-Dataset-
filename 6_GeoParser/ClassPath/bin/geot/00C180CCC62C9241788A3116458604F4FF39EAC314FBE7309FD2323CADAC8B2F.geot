                Definition:

                
                    A Catalog service is defined as Data Handling Services that provide a listing
 of items arranged systematically with descriptive details. These items include, but are not limited to, data sets, reference materials, and other services.
 Catalog services are, however, limited to topics of relevance to the Earth
 Sciences and Global Environmental Change. These foci must be reflected by a
 majority of the items listed in the catalog. Catalog services also include any
 tools that may be used to create a catalog or facilitate the inclusion or
 maintenance of a listing within a catalog. EXAMPLES: NASA's Global Change Master Directory, Geospatial One-Stop (catalogs) and docBUILDER (metadata management).
