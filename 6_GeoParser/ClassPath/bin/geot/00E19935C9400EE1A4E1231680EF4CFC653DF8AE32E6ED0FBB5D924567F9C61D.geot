                            We have observations from three ships near Antarctica, the R/V Polar Duke the R/V Nathaniel B. Palmer and the R/V Laurence M. Gould. Data from 23 August 1993 are available via ftp and the files are ...

                                Measurement of ocean waves and ice coupled waves near a fast ice boundary, McMurdo Sound  [K137_1990_1993_NZ_1]
                            
                            
                            
                            
                            

                            
                            Ocean waves interact with Antarctic ice. Pack ice acts as a barrier to wave penetration, and attenuates the propagating waves. The presence of fast ice changes the nature of the wave interaction so ...
