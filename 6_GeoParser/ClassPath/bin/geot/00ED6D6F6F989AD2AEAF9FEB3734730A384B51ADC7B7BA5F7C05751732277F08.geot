	I have 29 images in my list


	
	The first time you select an image to My List, a separate browser 
	window will open. This page will list the set of images you have 
	selected as favorites from the Photojournal. This list is kept for a short period of time, 
	approximately 60 days. The way we associate you with your list is through a
	persistent cookie left on your computer. This cookie is nothing more
	than a unique key that allows the Photojournal to make this association.
	Once created, this list is only modifiable from the same computer.
	Information stored in the cookie on your computer is used by the
	Photojournal server only during your session. If you configure your
	Web browser not to use cookies, you will not be able to create and refer
	back to a personal list of favorite images. To view your current list, click on 
	a marked entry for your list from the catalog page, or add another favorite. For more information, see JPL's Privacy Policy.
