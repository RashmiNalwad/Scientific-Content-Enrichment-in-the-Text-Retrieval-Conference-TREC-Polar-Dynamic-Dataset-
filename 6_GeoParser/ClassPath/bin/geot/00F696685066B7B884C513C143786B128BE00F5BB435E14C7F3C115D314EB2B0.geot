        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            In-situ experiments investigated the constitutive and fracture 
 behavior of edge-notched, square plate full-thickness specimens of 
 first-year floating sea ice in McMurdo Sound. The dataset contains the 
 physical properties included temperature, salinity and density 
 profiles, the microstructure of the ice sheet, the cyclic loading and 
  ... fracture response and acoustic emission. 
 
 The mechanical and fracture properties of the annual sea ice in 
 Antarctic were studied to develop improved, physically based models of 
 the breakup process. The fieldwork took place during the Austral 
 spring 2001 in McMurdo Sound. Nine fracture tests and four tensile 
 tests were conducted on 5m x 5m and 10m x 10m edge-notched square 
 plates of ice, the ice thickness being 1.4m. The experiments employed 
 loading ramps either to a specified load level or to tensile failure, 
 or cyclic loading involved the application of a haversine waveform 
 with a range of peak load levels and frequencies from 10-3 to 5 x 10-2 
 Hz. Field characterizations included salinity, density and temperature 
 profiles. The crystallography of the ice sheet was examined using 
 standard thin sections from 0.1m-diameter cores, and micrographs were 
 obtained on-site from these sections to document the sub-grain 
 structure. The crack opening displacements were measures at three 
 points along the traction-free crack surface: 
 crack-mouth-opening-displacement (CMOD), 
 intermediate-crack-opening-displacement (COD) and 
 near-crack-tip-opening-displacement (NCTOD). Gages were also placed 
 ahead of the crack tip to identify the crack opening displacement when 
 the crack advanced. Two acoustic emission (AE) transducers were 
 mounted on the ice surface to monitor the micro-cracking levels in the 
 crack tip process zone.
