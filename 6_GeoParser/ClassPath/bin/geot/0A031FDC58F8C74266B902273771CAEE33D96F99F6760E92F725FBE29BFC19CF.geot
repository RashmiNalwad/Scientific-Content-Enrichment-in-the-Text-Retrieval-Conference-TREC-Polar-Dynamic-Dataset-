Another dust storm blew off the coast of Sudan over the Red Sea on August 5, 2006. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) flying onboard NASA’s Aqua satellite took this picture the same day. In this image, the dust appears in beige. Multiple plumes of varying width and opacity all blow toward the east in a slightly clockwise direction over the Red Sea.
