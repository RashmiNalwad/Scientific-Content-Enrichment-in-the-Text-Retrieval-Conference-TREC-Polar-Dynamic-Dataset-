        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The significant impact of enhanced UV-B radiation on Antarctic marine 
 organisms has been widely recognized. So far studies on Antarctic 
 terrestrial organisms are few. 
 
 The aim of the project is to determine how cryptogams and 
 phanerogams (terrestrial algae, lichens mosses, the grass Deschampsia 
 antarctica) in Antarctic coastal habitats respond to Global 
 Environmental Change (especially UV-B  ... radiation). 
 
 The project comprises three parts: 
 
 a. Monitoring changing environmental conditions - with 
 particular emphasis on ultraviolet - and photosynthetically active 
 radiation and temperature - in an area beneath the spring Antarctic 
 ozone 'hole', by establishing a measuring station able to measure 
 these environ-mental parameters over prolonged periods (5 years or 
 more); 
 
 b. Monitoring possible changes in Antarctic coastal vegetation 
 by selective exclusion of UV - B form the natural irradiation and 
 increased temperature in comparison with the vegetation under natural 
 circumstances over prolonged periods (> 10 years); 
 
 c. Investigate the ability of selected species to maintain 
 physiological performance under increased stress (UV - B, and 
 integrate the results of whole organism data with other investigations 
 on biochemistry and cellular physiology. This third part will comprise 
 measurements of the photosynthetic activity and biochemistry of 
 selected species in the field and laboratory experiments on the same 
 species in a controlled environment.
