        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            CHAIN-2D is a computer program for simulating two-dimensional variably 
 saturated water flow, heat transport, and the movement of solutes involved in 
 sequential first-order decay reactions. The program numerically solves the 
 Richards' equation for saturated-unsaturated water flow and the 
 convection-dispersion equation for heat and solute transport. The flow equation 
 incorporates a sink term to  ... account for water uptake by plant roots. The water 
 flow part of the model can deal with prescribed head, gradient, and flux 
 boundaries, as well as boundaries controlled by atmospheric conditions. Free 
 drainage boundary condition and a simplified representation of nodal drains 
 using results of electric analog experiments is also included. The heat 
 transport equation considers transport due to conduction and convection with 
 flowing water. The solute transport equations consider convective-dispersive 
 transport in the liquid phase, as well as diffusion in the gaseous phase. The 
 transport equations also include provisions for nonlinear nonequilibrium 
 reactions between the solid and liquid phases, linear equilibrium reactions 
 between the liquid and gaseous phases, zero-order production, and two 
 first-order degradation reactions: one which is independent of other solutes, 
 and one which provides the coupling between solutes involved in the sequential 
 first-order decay reactions. The program may be used to analyze water and 
 solute movement in unsaturated, partially saturated, or fully saturated porous 
 media. CHAIN-2D can handle flow regions delineated by irregular boundaries. The 
 flow region itself may be composed of nonuniform soils having an arbitrary 
 degree of local anisotropy. Flow and transport can occur in the vertical plane, 
 the horizontal plane, or in a three-dimensional region exhibiting radial 
 symmetry about the vertical axis. 
 
 The governing flow and transport equations are solved numerically using 
 Galerkin-type linear finite element schemes. Depending upon the size of the 
 problem, the matrix equations resulting from discretization of the governing 
 equations are solved using either Gaussian elimination for banded matrices or 
 the conjugate gradient method for symmetric matrices, or the ORTHOMIN method 
 for asymmetric matrices. The program is written in ANSI standard FORTRAN 77. 
 Computer memory is a function of the problem definition. This report serves as 
 both a user manual and reference document. Detailed instructions are given for 
 data input preparation. Example input and selected output files are also 
 provided.
