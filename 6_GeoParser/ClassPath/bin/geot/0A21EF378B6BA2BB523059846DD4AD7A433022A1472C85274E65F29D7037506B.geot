        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The Monthly Gridded Cloud Averages (ISCCP-D2like-GEO) archival data product contains monthly and monthly 3-hourly (GMT-based) 1°x1° gridded regional mean geostationary satellite (GEO) cloud properties as a function of 18 cloud types, similar to the ISCCP D2 product, where the cloud properties are stratified by pressure, optical depth, and phase. The ISCCP-D2like-GEO product is a 5-satellite,  ... daytime 3-hourly GMT, 8-km nominal resolution, geostationary-only cloud product limited to 60°N to 60°S. The ISCCP-D2like-GEO is a daytime-only product, where the cloud retrievals incorporate only the visible and IR channels common to all geostationary satellites for spatial consistency. Each ISCCP-D2like file covers a single month. 
 
 Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES missions are a follow-on to the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument (PFM) was launched on November 27, 1997 as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the EOS flagship Terra on December 18, 1999. Two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched on board EOS Aqua on May 4, 2002. The newest CERES instrument (FM5) was launched on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite on October 28, 2011.
