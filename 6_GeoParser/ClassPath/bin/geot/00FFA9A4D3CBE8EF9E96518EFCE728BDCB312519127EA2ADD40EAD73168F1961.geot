                            Abstract: 
                            As part of the Long Term Ecological Research in the McMurdo 
 Dry Valleys of Antarctica, meteorological data was collected from 
 various locations throughout Taylor, Wright and Victoria 
 Valleys. These files contain data for the Explorer's Cove meteorology 
 station.
