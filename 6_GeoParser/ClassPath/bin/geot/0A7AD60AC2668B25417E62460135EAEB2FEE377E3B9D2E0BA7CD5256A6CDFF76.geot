                            Abstract: 
                            The NASA IceBridge BGM-3 Gravimeter L0 Raw Accelerations (IGBGM0) data set contains gravity measurements taken over Antarctica using the BGM-3 Gravimeter instrument. The data were collected by scientists working on the Investigating the Cryospheric Evolution of the Central Antarctic Plate (ICECAP) project, which is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) with additional support from NASA Operation IceBridge. The data are stored in ASCII text format and are available for periodic, ongoing campaigns from 2009 to the present via FTP.
