                Definition:

                
                    Fish are, broadly speaking, any poikilothermic (or organism whose
body temperature varies according to the temperature of its surroundings)
legless, aquatic vertebrate that possesses a series of gills on each side
of the pharynx, a two-chambered heart, no internal nostrils, and at least
a median fin as well as a tail fin.
