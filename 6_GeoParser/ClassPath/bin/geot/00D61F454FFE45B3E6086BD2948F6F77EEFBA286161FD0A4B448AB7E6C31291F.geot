        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            1995/96 
 Characterization of minor and trace metals in lacustrine ecosystems (Carezza 
 Lake, Inexpressible Island, Tarn Flat, Edmondson Point). Determinations in 
 lake waters, sediments, algae and soil. The scientific objectives achieved were 
 the completion of the yearly temporal sequence and the prosecution of the 
 collection of historical series of data on the concentrations of minor, trace 
 and  ... ultratrace metals in samples from lacustrine ecosystems, with the aim of 
 acquiring information on the distribution among water, soil, algae and 
 sediments and on their biogeological cycles. The data obtained allow to outline 
 interesting correlations among the variations of the various investigated 
 elements, which will become more evident after including the data from the 
 subsequent sampling campaigns. Sampling of surface water from Gerlache Inlet. 
 As to seawater samples, we studied the temporal profiles of metal 
 concentrations with particular regard to the effect of the presence and melting 
 of ice-pack. Such variations are discussed taking into account the different 
 chemical forms in which the considered elements are distributed in the 
 investigated ecosystems. 
 
 1996-97 
 Distribution of pollutants in marine and lacustrine matrices. During the 
 1996-97 Campaign, no samples were collected either from coastal or open 
 seawater, or from the lakes investigated during the previous campaigns. The 
 measurements and determinations on the samples collected during the 1994-95 and 
 1995-96 Campaigns were completed. 
 
 1997-98 
 Our research activities were aimed at the determination of trace and ultratrace 
 metals in seawater from Gerlache Inlet and other areas of the Ross Sea. In 
 particular, we examined samples collected in Gerlache Inlet at different depth 
 and periods, and depth profiles from six different parts in the open sea and 
 discussed the temporal and spatial variations observed. The results obtained 
 were treated with multivariate techniques. As to Carezza Lake, Tarn Flat and 
 Edmonson Point, the following matrices were samples: water, algae, sediments 
 and soil from the surroundings of the lakes. The scientific objectives achieved 
 were again the implementation of yearly temporal sequences of minor, trace and 
 ultratrace metal determinations in samples collected from the lacustrine 
 ecosystems, in order to obtain information on the distribution of heavy metals 
 among water, sediment, soil and algae. 
 
 1998-99 
 Our Operative Unit received samples of surface seawater obtained with the new 
 device for the collection of surface microlayer. The samples were obtained in 
 Gerlache Inlet, from which water was collected also in the previous Campaign. 
 Such samples allow to characterize the enrichment, which takes place also for 
 metal species, in the marine surface microlayer. Moreover this third year of 
 activity within the period 1996/99 was dedicated to the completion of the 
 numerous determinations on samples of lacustrine and marine matrices. We 
 finished the sets of measurements, already partially carried out, on the 
 samples collected on the previous campaigns and analyzed the specimen collected 
 in the 1997/98 campaign. Afterwards, the data obtained were treated with 
 statistical techniques, in order to obtain as much information as possible. 
 Moreover, many samples of lacustrine matrices were collected for our Operating 
 Unit from Carezza Lake. Such samples were analyzed for metal species in order 
 to prosecute the collection of the yearly temporal sequence of data for 
 lacustrine ecosystems. 
 
 1999/2000 
 No samplings were performed for our Research Unit, and our activities were 
 directed mainly to the completion of the analyses of the samples collected in 
 the previous campaigns. 
 
 2000/01 
 We received samples of seawater sampled from three different depth profiles, 
 named CA, CA2 and D1. Profiles CA and CA2 are located near Adare Cape, while 
 profile D1 is located in the polynya zone near Drygalsky Glacier, which 
 represents one of the most important zones for the formation of high density 
 waters. Also for these results statistical analyses have been completed in 
 order to obtain the highest number of information obtainable. In addition 
 samples of the marine superficial microlayer have been analyzed, sampled from 
 Gerlache Inlet, and their concentrations were compared with those obtained from 
 the corresponding subsuperficial layers. For the lacustrine environment, 
 prosecuting the continuous activities of our Research Unit, we received samples 
 of the various matrices from Carezza lake (lake water, algae, sediment). 
 
 2001/02 
 Considering that the 2001/2002 campaign involved activities mainly centered on 
 Terra Nova Bay, coastal seawater samples from Gerlache Inlet were analyzed, 
 along three vertical profiles (one for each of the three different periods of 
 the campaign), constituted by four different samples (corresponding to the 
 surface, the maximum of fluorescence, the thermocline, and the bottom 
 vicinity). The determinations regarded the concentration of minor and trace 
 metals. For what regards the lacustrine environment, samples from Carezza lake 
 were investigated for the determination of metals in water, surrounding soil, 
 in algae, in sediment. The samples were collected in two different periods: 
 corresponding to the melting of the ice covering the lake and in a second 
 period before the closure of the campaign. 
 
 2002/03 
 Taking into account that the activities in Antarctica during the expedition 
 2002/2003 involved the participation of the Chemical Contamination Sector to 
 the oceanographic campaign in Ross Sea, our Research Unit took part to the 
 characterization and to the study of the modifications that oceanic water 
 masses undergo in the proximity of Antarctica. For this reason we received 
 seawater samples, for investigating the distribution and the variation of metal 
 species, with particular regard to the metal traces Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, for 
 characterizing their modifications in different locations of Ross Sea and along 
 vertical sampling profiles. In addition to these, other elements, present in 
 higher concentration, have been investigated in order to monitor physical 
 phenomena and variations involving conservative quantities. Such determination 
 were directed to the study of the effects of the interaction of the waters from 
 the Circumpolar Deep Water current with the Ross Ice-Shelf. For characterizing 
 the interactions and fluxes of the above mentioned waters the distributions 
 along vertical profiles were investigated in the proximity of Cape Adare, along 
 the route of the High Salinity Shelf Water towards Cape Adare, in the zone of 
 formation of the Ice Shelf Water (point F) and in the zone of the mooring 
 (points H1 and H2). Finally, since our Research Unit pointed out that the 
 concentrations of the major, minor and trace metals are higher in the lake 
 water samples collected at the end of the antarctic summer in comparison to 
 those sampled at the beginning of the summer season, we received for this 
 campaign two water samples collected from Carezza Lake at the beginning of the 
 thaw (31/12/2002) and at the end of the antarctic campaign in order to verify 
 the existence of a temporal trend of the metal concentrations in antarctic 
 lakes. With reference to this lake we received also a sample of sediment and of 
 algae. 
 
 2003/04 
 With reference to the lacustrine environment samples from the lakes 
 Inexpressible Island, Tarn Flat, Edmonson Point were collected. The samples 
 were analyzed for determining metals in water, surrounding soil, sediment, 
 algae. For Tarn Flat and Inexpressible Island lakes we determined the metal 
 content also in the suspended particulate matter. For the marine environment, 
 the Research Unit received one sediment core taken near the Hells Gate Ice 
 Shelf and one taken in open ocean near one of the canyons through which shelf 
 waters flow towards the deepest depths of the Ross Sea.
