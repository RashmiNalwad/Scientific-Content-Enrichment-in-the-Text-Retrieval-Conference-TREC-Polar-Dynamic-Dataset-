        Summary


        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            BIOMOC is a two-dimensional model that can simulate the transport 
 and biotransformation of multiple reacting solutes. The program is 
 general and flexible, allowing for any combination of biodegradation 
 processes. A number of expressions for biological transformation 
 rates have been included as options in the code. These include 
 single, multiple, and minimum  ... Monod kinetics and competitive, 
 noncompetitive, and Haldane inhibition. The kinetic parameters can 
 be formulated to simulate zero-order or first-order approximations 
 of biodegradation rates. The growth and decay of several microbial 
 populations performing the transformations is also accounted for. 
 The microbial growth can be disabled, limited by biomass inhibition, 
 or limited by the availability of a specified nutrient.
