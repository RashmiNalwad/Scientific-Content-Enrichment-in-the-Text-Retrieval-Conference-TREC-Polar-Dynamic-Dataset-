        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            An occupancy survey of Adelie penguin breeding distribution along the coast between the Rauer Group and the Amery Ice Shelf was carried out in 2009/10. General details of the occupancy surveys are given in the overall metadata record. Details specific to this occupancy survey campaign are given below. 
 
 The survey covered 598 sites of potential breeding habitat in the following subgroups from the  ... site GIS for Adelie penguin potential breeding habitat: 
 
 BOL_SG_01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08 
 LAR_SG_01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10 
 SAN_SG_01 
 SVE_SG_01, 02, 03, 04 
 
 The survey was undertaken from a Squirrel helicopter on 29 November 2009 at an altitude of 750 m. 
 
 The data file has the following fields: 
 
 SubgroupID: identifying code for the map on which the site occurs, obtained from the site GIS 
 SiteID: identifying code for the site from the site GIS 
 SiteName: site name, if one exists 
 Day: day of search 
 Month: month of search 
 Year: year of search 
 Occupancy: P for present, A for absent 
 Feature observed: P for penguins, G for guano 
 
 The latitude and longitude of each site can be obtained from the 'Sites' file in the parent metadata record for occupancy surveys. 
 
 Furthermore the dataset also contains a shapefile with islands west of the Rauer Group with penguin colonies based on the 2009/10 aerial presence-absence survey. The coastline in the polygons is from the dataset described by the metadata record 'Australian Antarctic Territory Coastline 2003', Entry ID: AAT_Coastline_2003.
