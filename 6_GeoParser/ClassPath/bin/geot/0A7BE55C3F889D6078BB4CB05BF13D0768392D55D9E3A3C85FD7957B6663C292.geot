          Data Updates
        

        
          All of the data available within this site are subject to
          updating at any point. Different data may be substituted or
          the data-processing and image-rendering algorithms may be
          changed. The main purpose of this site is to provide a
          historical look at the development of atmospheric ozone, but
          that purpose does not extend to keeping a historical archive
          of all the data versions and processing algorithms used. 
        


        
          Missing Data
        

        
          On many days there are missing data points in parts of the
          data fields, and some days may have all of the data missing.
          To provide for visual continuity, these missing data points
          are interpolated using various spatial and temporal methods.
          The interpolated values are used in calculating quantities
          such as ozone hole area, but are never used in quantities such
          as minimum ozone.
