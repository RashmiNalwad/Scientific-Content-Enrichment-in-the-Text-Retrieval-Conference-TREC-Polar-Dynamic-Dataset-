    Description

                 In general, DNA sequencing involves determining the positions of labeled 


                
            
                 nucleotides that have been incorporated into a replicated piece of DNA. 


                
            
                 Traditionally, the nucleotides were labeled with radioactive isotopes and the 


                
            
                 sequnce read using autoradiography. The use of an automated DNA sequencer, 


                
            
                 however, negates the need for radioactive isotopes, and instead, uses a 


                
            
                 fluorescent dye to label the nucleotides. A laser stimulates the fluorescent 


                
            
                 dye, and then, the fluorescent emissions are collected on a charge coupled 


                
            
                 device that determines the wavelengths of those emissions. Each labeled 


                
            
                 nucleotide is distinguished by a different wavelenth.
