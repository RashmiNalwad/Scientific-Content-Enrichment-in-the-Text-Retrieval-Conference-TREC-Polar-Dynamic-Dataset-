                            Abstract: 
                            The level-3 MODIS global Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Emissivity 8-day data are composed from the daily 1-kilometer LST product (MOD11A1) and stored on a 1-km Sinusoidal grid as the average values of clear-sky LSTs during an 8-day period. 
 
 MOD11A2 is comprised of daytime and nighttime LSTs, quality assessment, observation times, view angles, bits of clear sky days and nights, and emissivities estimated in Bands 31 and 32 from land cover types.
