                            Abstract: 
                            Production is the production of primary energy, i.e. hard coal, lignite/brown coal, peat, crude oil, NGLs, natural gas, combustible renewables and waste, nuclear, hydro, geothermal, solar and the heat from heat pumps that is extracted from the ambient environment. Production is calculated after removal of impurities (e.g. sulphur from natural gas). Hydro shows the energy content of the electricity produced in hydro power plants. Hydro output excludes output from pumped storage plants.
