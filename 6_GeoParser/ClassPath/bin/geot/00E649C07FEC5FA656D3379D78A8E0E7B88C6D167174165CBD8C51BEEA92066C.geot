                            Abstract: 
                            The Kentucky Geography Network is a "one-stop-shop" for geographic data 
 resources related to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. A variety of datasets can be 
 located and accessed, static map products can be downloaded, and several 
 Internet Mapping solutions are accessible via the site. Use the new geographic 
 explorer to locate maps and geographic data content for a particular part of 
 the state or search based on keyword or theme type. 
 
 The Kentucky Geography Network and its powerful geographic explorer are now a 
 part of the Geography Network and support its mission to share geographic 
 knowledge with the world.
