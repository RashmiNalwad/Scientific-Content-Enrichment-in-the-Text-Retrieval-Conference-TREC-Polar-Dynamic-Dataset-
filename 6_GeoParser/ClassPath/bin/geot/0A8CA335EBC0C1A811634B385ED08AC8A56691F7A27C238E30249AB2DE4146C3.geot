      This
      is a beta 1.3e version of the ShockSim program, and you are invited
      to participate in the beta testing. If you find errors in the program or
      would like to suggest improvements, please send an e-mail to Thomas.J.Benson@nasa.gov.


 Due to IT
      security concerns, many users are currently experiencing problems running NASA Glenn
      educational applets. There are
      security settings that you can adjust that may correct
      this problem.
 









This page shows an interactive Java applet for supersonic flow past a wedge or cone.
The applet shows the shock waves generated by the object and the value of the
flow variables downstream of the shocks.





      ShockSim


 
            With this software you can investigate how shock waves
            are formed by the 
            supersonic flow
            of a gas past a 
            wedge
             or a
            cone.
            Depending on the Mach number and the size of object,
            attached oblique
            shocks, or 
            detached
            normal shocks are formed at the leading edge of the object.
            You can study this flow by
            interactively changing the values of different input parameters.



            There are several different software packages available at the
            Beginner's Guide to Compressible Aerodynamics to study the
            generation of oblique or normal shock waves.
            This web page contains the on-line version of the single shock program.
            It includes an on-line user's manual which describes the
            various options available in the program and includes hyperlinks to
            pages in the
            Beginner's Guide to Compressible Flow
            and
            NASA's Guide to Hypersonics
            describing the math and science of shock waves.
            More experienced users can select a
            version of the program which does not include
            these instructions and loads faster on your computer.
            There are two separate packages which solve for flow past a supersonic
            cone  and a supersonic
            wedge.
            There is also a special program to solve for
            multiple shock waves
            with shock reflections and intersections. The multiple shock program
            also solves for Prandtl-Meyer
            expansions which occur when the flow is
            turned into an expanding region.         
            You can download these programs to your computer
            by clicking on this yellow button:



  



            With the downloaded version, you can run the programs off-line and do not
            have to be connected to the Internet.



           If you see only a grey box at the top of this page, be sure that Java is
           enabled in your browser. If Java is enabled, and you are using the Windows XP
           operating system, you need to get a newer version of Java. Go to this link:

           simply click away from the slider and then back to it.
           
           If
           the arrows on the end of the sliders disappear, click in the areas
           where the left and right arrow images should appear, and they
           should reappear.

            


        GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

        
           This program is designed to be interactive, so you have to work with the program.
           You choose a particular flow problem by clicking on the white 
           choice button at the upper right of the program. You can choose between flow past a wedge
           and flow past a cone.
           The current value of flow variables are presented to you in boxes. 
           By convention, a white box with
           black numbers is an input box and you can change the value of the number. 
           To change the value in an input box, select the box by moving the cursor into the box
           and clicking the mouse, then backspace over the old number, enter a new number,
           then hit the Enter key on your keyboard. You must hit Enter
           to send the new value to the program.
           For most input variables you can also use a slider located next to the input box.
           Click on the slider bar, hold down and drag the slider bar to change values, or
           you can click on the arrows at either end of the slider.
           A black box with
           yellow numbers is an output box and the value is computed by the program.
           There are some choices which you must make regarding the display
           of computed results by using a choice box.
           A choice box has a descriptive word displayed and an arrow at the right of the
           box. To make a choice, click on the arrow, hold down and drag to
           make your selection.
        


           

            SCREEN

            The
              program screen is divided into three main parts:

            
              	At the
                  left of the screen is a graphic of the wedge or cone and 
                  shock waves that you are studying. 
                
	On the
                  upper right side of the screen is the input panel.
                
	On the
                  lower right side of the screen are the results of
                  the calculations. 
                


             
            GRAPHICS
              WINDOW 

            
              On the graphics display, supersonic flow is from left to right.
              The wedge or cone is shown in red.
              Oblique shock waves are drawn as blue lines. 
              Normal shocks are colored magenta. For the conical flow problem, flow
              variables are constant along rays of a cone starting at the leading edge.
              The rays are shown in blue. You can choose to display the values of the flow variables
              for a particular ray on the output panel. The ray that you choose is shown
              in red on the graphics panel.
              Streamlines from upstream and flowing through the shock waves are shown in black.
            


            NUMERICAL
              INPUT

            Numerical
              input to the program is entered at the upper right. 
              You can specify the free stream
              Mach number by using either the
              input box or the slider. You can also specify the angles for the
              wedge or cone. The
              gamma variable is the ratio of
              specific heats
              of the gas.
            

               
            NUMERICAL
              OUTPUT

            Numerical
              output from the program is displayed at the lower right.
              The output for the conical flow is displayed by Rays, 
              with each ray beginning at the tip of the cone. 
              You select which ray to display by using the white and blue
              choice button.
              The output variables on the right
              are referenced to flow upstream of the shock, 
              which are the free stream conditions.
              Mach
              below the Ray button is the 
              Mach number
              on the surface of the cone. Mach to the
              right of the zone button is the Mach number along the selcted ray.
              Angle is the angle of the selected ray, 
              while Turning is the total amount that 
              the flow has been turned relative to free stream direction. 
              Shock Angle is
              the angle of the shock wave. The static and total
              pressure ratio
              are listed, followed by the
              temperature 
              and
              density
              ratios. For the cone, these values are calculated using the
              oblique or
              normal 
              shock relations, followed by an 
              isentropic compression to the ray Mach number.
              The ray Mach number is determined by the
              Taylor-Maccoll analysis,
               For the wedge problem, flow variable values are determined by the 
              oblique or
              normal
               shock relations.
              


            NEW
              FEATURES

            The
              Educations Program Office will continue to improve and update
              ShockModeler based on user input. Changes from previous versions of
              the program include:

            	On 12 Sep
                11 version 1.3e was released. This version of the program was the first
                release of the computer program. The version number reflects the fact that
                the program was derived from Version 1.2 of the single wedge shock program. The
                addition of the Taylor-Maccoll analysis for the cone has lead to a re-organization
                of the information at the compressible flow web site. Versions 1.3a-1.3d were
                developmental versions of the program and not released to the public.
