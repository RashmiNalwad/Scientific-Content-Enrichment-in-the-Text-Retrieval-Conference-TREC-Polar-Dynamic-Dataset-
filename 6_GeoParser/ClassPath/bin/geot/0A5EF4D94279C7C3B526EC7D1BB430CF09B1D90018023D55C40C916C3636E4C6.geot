        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The benthic marine community in the Pacific Island Network (PACN) is a complex ecologic system and a diverse taxonomic environment, including algae and corals and other invertebrates. Reef-building corals are the primary architectural organism and are sensitive to environmental degradation; therefore, they are a good indicator of overall health for nearshore marine ecosystems. Primary stressors to  ... coral reefs include disease, bleaching, sedimentation, eutrophication, storms, and global climate change. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has proposed using coral reefs as a worldwide indicator ecosystem for global climate change (Spalding et al. 2004). For these reasons, the PACN has chosen to implement long term monitoring of benthic marine communities. Benthic marine communities is most closely linked with marine fish, and monitoring efforts will be conducted at the same time and location to maximize data value 
    
                        

                    
                    
                        
                            

                            Purpose: 
                            To store long term monitoring data for benthic marine communities and marine fish.
