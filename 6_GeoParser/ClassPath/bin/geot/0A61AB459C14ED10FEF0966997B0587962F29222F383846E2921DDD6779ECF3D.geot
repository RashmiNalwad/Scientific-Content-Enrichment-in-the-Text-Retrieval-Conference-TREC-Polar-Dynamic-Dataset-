        Biomass burning in Southeast Asia peaks in late  winter or early spring as farmers begin to prepare land for  seasonal planting. The widespread nature of the burning  creates a seasonal pattern of emissions that play a  significant role in regional air pollution, including  tropospheric ozone. (Ozone can be both beneficial  and harmful in the atmosphere, depending on its altitude.  High up in the stratosphere, ozone protects the planet from  harmful UV radiation. Closer to earth, tropospheric ozone is  a harmful air pollutant.)
Like most parts of the world, the burning in Southeast Asia  exhibits a diurnal (daily) cycle, in which burning is less  widespread in the morning and increases throughout the day.  Compare this morning image of Southeast Asia, including  (left to right) Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam,  captured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging  Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra  satellite to the same area captured by Aqua MODIS  in the afternoon. Note the dramatic  increase in fires (red dots) in the afternoon image. This  image was acquired Jan. 31, 2003.
