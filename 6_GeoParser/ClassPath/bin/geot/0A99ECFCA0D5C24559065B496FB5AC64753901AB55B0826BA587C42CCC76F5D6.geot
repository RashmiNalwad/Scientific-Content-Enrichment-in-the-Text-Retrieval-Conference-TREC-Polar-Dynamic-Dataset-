    Since January 2008, the U.S. Geological Survey has been providing free terrain-corrected and radiometrically calibrated Landsat data via the Internet. This revolutionary data policy provides the opportunity to use all the data in the U.S. Landsat archive and to consider the systematic utility of Landsat data for long-term large-area monitoring.

The NASA funded Web-enabled Landsat Data (WELD) project is systematically generating 30m composited Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) mosaics of the conterminous United States and Alaska from 2005 to 2012. The WELD products are developed specifically to provide consistent data that can be used to derive land cover as well as geophysical and biophysical products for regional assessment of surface dynamics and to study Earth system functioning.  The WELD products are free and are available via the internet.

The WELD products are processed so that users do not need to apply the equations and spectral calibration coefficients and solar information to convert the ETM+ digital numbers to reflectance and brightness temperature, and successive products are defined in the same coordinate system and align precisely, making them simple to use for multi-temporal applications. They provide the first instance of continental-scale science-quality Landsat data with a level of pre-processing comparable to the NASA MODIS land products.

Funded by NASA NNH06ZDA001N Making Earth System data records for Use in Research Environments (MEASURES).
