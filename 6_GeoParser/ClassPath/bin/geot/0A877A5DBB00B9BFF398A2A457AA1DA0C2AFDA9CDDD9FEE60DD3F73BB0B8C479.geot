        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            This record includes two datasets and accompanying code. 
 
 The anisotropic flow dataset provides velocity and fabric evolution of anisotropic ice for several numerical experiments. The experiments examine how differing stress regimes and initial c-axis crystal fabrics can affect flow. Contained are VTU format files of finite element output of velocity (m/yr) as well as the second order fabric  ... orientation tensor, in addition to the beginning fabric orientation tensor. VTU files are readable with the open-source ParaView package. 
 
 Also included are python2 and Fortran 90 codes for computation of various fabric parameters, as well as to compute the time derivatives of the A and B fabric tensors for computation of the material derivative of the fabric evolution equation. 
 
 The snow and firn anisotropy dataset includes snow and firn properties corresponding to several steady-state and time-varying climate histories representing different sites on the Antarctic continent. The model divides the firn pack into layers, each of which has an individual density, age, mass, temperature, grain size distribution, and grain orientation distribution. 
 
 The record also includes the model's Matlab code, tested on Matlab versions 2007b and 2009a. The code can take advantage of parallel processors but does not require them.

                                Description: 
                                The U.S research community is conducting a deep ice coring project in West Antarctica for studies of climate, ice sheet history and cryobiology. This project is collecting a deep ice core from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) ice flow divide and integrating approximately 20 separate but synergistic projects to analyze the ice and interpret the records.
