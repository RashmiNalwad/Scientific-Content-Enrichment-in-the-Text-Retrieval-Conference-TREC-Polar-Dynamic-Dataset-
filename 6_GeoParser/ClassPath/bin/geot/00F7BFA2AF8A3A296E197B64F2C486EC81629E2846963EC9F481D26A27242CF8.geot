          Data description
        

        
        
          The Antarctic continent is circled by a strong jet stream in
          the stratosphere (above 12 km or 39,000 ft). Looking down on
          the South Pole, this jet stream flows around Antarctica in a
          clockwise sense. This jet stream isolates air over Antarctica
          from air in the midlatitudes. The region poleward of this jet
          stream is called the Antarctic polar vortex. A stronger jet
          stream flow results in greater isolation of polar air from
          midlatitude air (less mixing). The air inside the Antarctic
          polar vortex is also much colder then midlatitude air.

          is a NASA reanalysis for the satellite era using a major new
          version of the Goddard Earth Observing System Data Assimilation
          System Version 5 (GEOS-5). The project focuses on historical
          analyses of the hydrological cycle in a broad range of weather and
          climate time scales. It places modern observing systems (such as
