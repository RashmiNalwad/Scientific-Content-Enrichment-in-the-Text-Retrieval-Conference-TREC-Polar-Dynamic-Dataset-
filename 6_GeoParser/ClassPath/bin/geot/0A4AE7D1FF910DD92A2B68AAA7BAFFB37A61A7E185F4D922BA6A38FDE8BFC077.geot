        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Data comprise records of vegetation change on Macquarie Island as a result of grazing by rabbits and possible effects of climatic change. Data include presence and absence of species, together with quantitative measures of plant abundance. Records cover the period 1965 - 2003; the majority of data relates to 1965 - 1982, with further records being obtained in 2003. Work is currently in progress  ... to re-establish the study exclosures, and it is planned that further records will be obtained in 2005. This will provide the basis for continuing monitoring, building on the 40-year period for which records will then be available. 
 
 The files are grouped together in folders of photos looking in the same direction. 
 
 The filenames indicate the date the photo was taken - eg 0368 means March of 1968.
