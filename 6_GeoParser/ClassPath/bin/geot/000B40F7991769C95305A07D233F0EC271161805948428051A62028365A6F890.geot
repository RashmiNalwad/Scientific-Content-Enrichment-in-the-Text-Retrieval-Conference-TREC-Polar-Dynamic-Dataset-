                            Abstract: 
                            This file contains a biology report Wilkes station in 1963. The data were collected in the Windmill Islands, at locations such as Lewis Island, Clarke Island, Frazier Islands (Islets), Ardery Island (Islet), Odbert Island and Petersen Island. 
 
 The report also contains meteorological observations, bird-banding data, and hand-drawn maps. 
 
 The observations were made of: 
 
 Adelie penguins 
 Emperor penguins 
 South polar skuas 
 Giant petrels 
 Cape pigeons 
 Silver-grey petrels 
 Antarctic petrels 
 Snow petrels 
 Wilson's storm petrels 
 Terns 
 Ross seals 
 Crabeater seals 
 Elephant seals 
 Wddell seals 
 Leopard seals 
 Killer whales. 
 
 The hard copy of the map has been archived by the Australian Antarctic Division library.
