          NASA SkyWatch 

            is a web based Java application (or applet) that can be used to generate 

            highly accurate acquisition information for an earth orbiting satellite. 

            Each time the satellite appears above the horizon for a specified ground 

            site, NASA SkyWatch will compute such information as range, azimuth, 

            and elevation. Also, NASA SkyWatch 

            will determine if any of the "pass" will be visible. Making a "sighting" 

            of a satellite is great fun and an excellent learning experience for 

            both children and adults.  

          
 NASA SkyWatch 

            is primarily an application to determine acquisition information - or 

            when a satellite will be above the horizon at a given place and time. 

            Once the acquisition data has been determined, a sighting is also possible 

            if 4 conditions have been met:
 

          
 

          
	The satellite must be above 

              the horizon  

            
	The observer must be in 

              darkness (sun below the observer's horizon)  

            
	The satellite must be in 

              sunlight (sun above the satellite's horizon)  

            
	The correct side of the 

              satellite must be lit  

          



           NASA SkyWatch 

            can be used for any Earth orbiting satellite - not just for the International Space Station. NASA SkyWatch regulary monitors 

		    major NASA satellites that may be of interest. Currently, the list of 

			satellites that can be selected include the following:

		  


		  
	The International Space Station (ISS)		  
			
		  
	The Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor Spacecraft (ACRIMSAT)
		  
		  
	The Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS-II/SeaWinds)

		  
	The Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere Spacecraft (AIM)
		  
		  
	The Aqua Spacecraft
		  
		  
	The Aquarius Spacecraft
		  
		  
	The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations Spacecraft (CALIPSO) 
		  
		  
	The CloudSat Spacecraft
		  
		  
	The Earth Observing-1 Spacecraft (EO-1)

		  
	The Galaxy Evolution Explorer Spacecraft (GALEX)
		  
		  
	The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Spacecraft (GRACE-1 and GRACE-2)
		  
		  
	The Hinode Spacecraft
		  
		  
	The Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
		  
		  
	The Jason-1 Spacecraft
		  
		  
	The Jason-2 Spacecraft
		  
		  
	The LandSat-7 Spacecraft
		  
		  
	The OrbView-2 Spacecraft (SeaStar)
		  
		  
	The QuickSCAT Spacecraft
		  
		  
	The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscope Imager Spacecraft (RHESSI)
		  
		  
	The Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer Spacecraft RXTE 
		  
		  
	The Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment Spacecraft SORCE
		  
		  
	The Suzaku Spacecraft
		  
		  
	The Swift Gamma Ray Burst Explorer Spacecraft
		  
		  
	The Terra Spacecraft
		  
		  
	The Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics Spacecraft (TIMED)
		  
		  
	The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission TRMM
			

           Every effort has been made 

            to develop NASA SkyWatch 

            as a simple to use yet powerful application to provide highly accurate 

            and detailed information. These help pages are being provided to guide 

            your way through NASA SkyWatch 

            the first few times it is used. You will find that once you learn NASA 

            SkyWatch's input requirements, 

            sighting information is just a few minutes away.  

          

        
 The NASA SkyWatch 

          input and results are divided into 7 sections - 4 for input and 3 for 

          output. These sections are in the form of "tabs" in the upper left of 

          the user interface. All that is required to jump from section to section 

          is to click on the tab. In these help pages, clicking on the tab will 

          take you to a detailed help page for that particular section. Once inside 

          the detailed help page, clicking on an input or output will display 

          more information about that item.  

        
 System Requirements:
 

          
 It is recommended that the 

            user be running a Pentium class (or equivalent) computer system. Slower 

            systems will run NASA SkyWatch 

            but may take considerable more time to complete. The applet is not resolution 

            independent and was developed for resolution of 800x600 on a Windows 

            based computer system. Other resolutions and operating systems will 

            work but some scrolling by the user may be required if less than 800x600. 

            Resolutions greater than 800x600 will also work but may not be readable 

            due the small character size.  

          

        
 Please note that due to the 

          complexity of this applet, you will need the Microsoft 

          Internet Explorer  version 4.0 or later. You can also use Netscape 

          Navigator version 4.06 or later. Macintosh systems require Internet 

          Explorer version 4.5 or later, plus the Macintosh OS Runtime Environment 

          for Java version 2.1 or later. Windows users require the Java version 1.4.2_04. 

          If you need to acquire these browsers, please do so before attempting to 

          run NASA SkyWatch.
