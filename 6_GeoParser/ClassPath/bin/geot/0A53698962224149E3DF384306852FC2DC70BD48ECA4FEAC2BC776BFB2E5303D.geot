                            Abstract: 
                            This dataset represents topographic features of Davis Station, Antarctica. 
 The mapped features include coastline, contours, spot heights, high water mark (the 0.4 m contour was used as the high water mark) and station infrastructure (buildings, masts, aerials, tanks, pipes and other structures). 
 
 The data are included in the data available for download from a Related URL below. 
 
  ... The data conform to the SCAR Feature Catalogue which includes data quality information. See a Related URL below. 
 Data described by this metadata record has Dataset_id = 16. 
 Each feature has a Qinfo number which, when entered at the 'Search datasets and quality' tab, provides data quality information for the feature. 
 
 Changes have occurred at the station since this dataset was produced. For example some buildings and other structures have been removed and some added. 
 As a result the data available for download from a Related URL below is updated with new data having different Dataset_id(s).

            The mapping was generated by analytical stereo plotting from aerial photography flown at 600 m and 4500 m on 11, 12 February 1997. The spatial data coverage is complete for the entire dataset. A topographical consistency check was carried out by the photogrammetrist. ArcInfo (GIS software) was used to do a topological consistency check. This check insures that all polygons are closed, nodes are  ... formed at the intersection of lines and that there is only one label within each polygon. 
 Features plotted from the 600 m photography have a horizontal accuracy of 0.1 m and a vertical accuracy of 0.05 m. These features have a Qinfo value of 111. The horizontal and vertical positional accuracy have been derived by examining the flying height (scale) of the aerial photography and the accuracy of the photo survey control points. 
 Features plotted from the 4500 m photography have a Qinfo value of 112. 
 
 Usually mapped to a Universal Transverse Mercator projection, Zone 43.
