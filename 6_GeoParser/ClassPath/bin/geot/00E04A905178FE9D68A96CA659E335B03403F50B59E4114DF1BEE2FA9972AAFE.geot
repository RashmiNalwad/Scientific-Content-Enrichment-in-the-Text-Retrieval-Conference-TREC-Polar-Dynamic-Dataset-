        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The oceanography of McMurdo Sound was investigated by collecting current meter data, water samples, ice cores, under ice turbulence and Conductivity (salinity)-Temperature-Depth (CTD) profiles of the full depth of the water column were collected along an east to west transect across the sound. At each site, approximately 5 kms apart, a hole was drilled in the ice, observations of temperature,  ... salinity and current turbulence were recorded. Two fixed moorings were deployed at each end of the traverse line for the period of the traverse to provide reference points for the oceanographic observations. Isotope measurements were taken from water samples collected from 10m and 200m at each transect site. Additional cores were sectioned and viewed under cross-polarised light in order to determine the ice structure. It is intended that the research carried out here will in time be able to be applied to a much wider Antarctic marine environment and consequently lead to a greater understanding of the relationship between the sea ice and the underlying ocean. The CTD profiles will be used to describe the water column structure of the sound and to investigate spatial variability in distribution of water masses, particularly Ice Shelf Water (ISW). Comparison with platelet ice abundance measurements from ice cores collected from the same sites will help to identify a causal link between flow of ISW, formation of frazil ice in the water column, and deposition of platelet ice as a method of sea-ice growth. 
 
 To characterise the relationship between the sea ice, ocean and atmosphere of Antarctica ice cores and water samples were taken in order to better understand and predict high-latitude coupled climate variability, and to underpin the management of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean in the context of the global climate system. It concentrates on the climate-related processes occurring within McMurdo Sound to the marginal ice zone. It covers a range of scales, from microns in structure of sea ice, to the order of thousands of kilometres in the process of sea ice dispersal in the Southern Ocean, and the relationships linking Antarctica to global climate variability and change.Ice core, water 
 
 During 2012/2013 further research was conducted in Under sea ice oceanographic data - salinity, current, pressure, ice-water interface data.
