        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            ESYS plc and the Department of Geomatic Engineering at University College 
 London (UCL) have been funded by the British National Space Centre (BNSC) to 
 develop a web GIS service to serve geographic data derived from remote sensing 
 datasets. Funding was provided as part of the BNSC International Co-operation 
 Programme 2 (ICP-2). 
 
  ... Particular aims of the project were to: 
 
 1. use Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC, recently renamed from the OpenGIS 
 Consortium) technologies for map and data serving; 
 
 2. serve datasets for Europe and Africa, particularly Landsat TM and Shuttle 
 Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) data; 
 
 3. provide a website giving access to the served data; 
 
 4. provide software scripts, etc., and a document reporting the data processing 
 and software set-up methods developed during the project. 
 
 ICEDS was inspired in particular by the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites 
 (CEOS) CEOS Landsat and SRTM Project (CLASP) proposal. An express intention of 
 ICEDS (aim 4 in the list above) was therefore that the solution developed by 
 ESYS and UCL should be redistributable, for example, to other CEOS members. 
 This was taken to mean not only software scripts but also the methods developed 
 by the project team to prepare the data and set up the server. In order to be 
 compatible with aim 4, it was also felt that the use of Open Source, or at 
 least 'free-of-cost' software for the Web GIS serving was an essential 
 component. After an initial survey of the Web GIS packages available at the 
 time , the ICEDS team decided to use the Deegree package, a free software 
 initiative founded by the GIS and Remote Sensing unit of the Department of 
 Geography, University of Bonn , and lat/lon . However the Red Spider web 
 mapping software suite was also provided by IONIC Software - this is a 
 commercial web mapping package but was provided pro bono by IONIC for this 
 project and has been used in parallel to investigate the possibilities and 
 limitations opened up by using a commercial package.
