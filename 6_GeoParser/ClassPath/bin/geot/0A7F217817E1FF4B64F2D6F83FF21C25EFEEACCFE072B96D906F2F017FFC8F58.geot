                            Abstract: 
                            Antarctic Multibeam Bathymetry and Geophysical Data Synthesis (AMBS) delivers shaded relief maps, bathymetry grids, multibeam bathymetry field data and other geophysical data from the Southern Ocean, primarily collected with the R/V N. B. Palmer. This effort initiated in 2003 with support of the Office of Polar Programs at the National Science Foundation. To learn more view the R/V Palmer Data  ... Acquisition Status Report, read other Project Related Documents, see what's new and explore Antarctic Related web links. 
 
 AntarcticMBS currently provides access to multibeam bathymetry and trackline geophysical data from 75% of all multibeam expeditions of the R/V Palmer within the Southern Ocean. 
 
 Use GeoMapApp to explore the relief of Antarctica, the bathymetry of the surrounding ocean and the interior of the ice sheet imaged by radar. You can create and download maps and grids from your explorations, as well as retrieve geophysical and geological data. View and explore trackline gravity and magnetics data, geochemical data from PetDB, seismicity, and seismic reflection profiles.
