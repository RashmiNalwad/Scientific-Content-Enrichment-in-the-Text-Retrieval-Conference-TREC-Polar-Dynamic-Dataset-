        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric regions (CEDAR) is a 
 program sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) designed to enhance 
 the capability of ground-based instruments to measure the upper atmosphere and 
 to coordinate instrument and model data for the benefit of the scientific 
 community. The CEDAR Data Base (formally the Incoherent Scatter Radar Data 
 Base) is a  ... cooperative project between the National Center for Atmospheric 
 Research (NCAR) and several institutions that provide upper atmosphere data and 
 model output for community use. The CEDAR Data Base contains: documentation, 
 catalogue information, geophysical indices, summary plots, analysis software, 
 and computer models. A catalogue is produced every year and is available on the 
 WWW at: 
 http://cedarweb.hao.ucar.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page 
 
 CEDAR instruments are located throughout the world. Only selected data from 
 each instrument is available in the CEDAR Data Base. The on-line CEDAR Data 
 Base contains information to contact investigators for additional data not 
 found in the Data Base. 
 
 The CEDAR Data Base currently contains approximately 10GB of data. A 
 complete inventory of data and data availability is obtainable from 
 the following: 
 
 http://cedarweb.hao.ucar.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page 
 
 The CEDAR Data Base consists of the following: 
 
 Geophysical Indices. Includes Dst, Kp, ap, Ap, solar 10.7 cm flux, 
 sunspot number, AE, and IMF parameters. 
 
 Large Model Output. Includes model output from the Assimilative 
 Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics (AMIE), Thermosphere Ionosphere 
 General Circulation Model (TIGCM), and Global-Scale Wave Model (GSWM). 
 
 Incoherent Scatter Radar. This is the primary data in the CEDAR Data 
 Base. Includes ionospheric electron densities, ion velocities, and 
 electron and ion temperatures. 
 
 Ionospheric Doppler Radars. HF ionospheric doppler radars are organized into a 
 collection of radars called SuperDARN (Super Dual Auroral Radar Network). 
 Eleven radars have data in the CEDAR Data Base. Basic parameters include 
 line-of-sight plasma irregularity and velocity spread. 
 
 Digisondes. Consists of ion drift data from the Qaanaaq Digisonde. 
 
 Fabry-Perot Interferometers. Basic parameters from FPI are 
 brightness, neutral temperature, and line-of-sight neutral winds. 
 
 IR Michelson Interferometers. Data include neutral temperatures 
 derived from nightglow hydroxyl (OH). 
 
 Lidar. Basic Lidar parameters are photocounts, relative neutral number 
 density, and sodium or iron density. 
 
 Middle Atmosphere Radars. Data are from MST radars, MF radars, LF 
 radars, meteor wind radars and ST radars. There is only limited data 
 in the CEDAR Data Base. Parameters include line-of-sight neutral winds 
 and turbulence. 
 
 Airglow Imagers and All-Sky Cameras. Data includes brightness data 
 from imagers. None of the imager data are in digital form. Some 
 airglow data is on video tape. 
 
 Models. Consists of both theoretical models and empirical models. 
 Source code is available from the CEDAR Data Base. Model output 
 consists of geomagnetic field data, electron densities, electric 
 fields, interpolations and models of NOAA and DMSP satellite data, 
 wind models, ionospheric parameters, and other data. 
 
 The CEDAR Data Base is accessible through the WWW and ftp, but users must have 
 a valid access form, available from the WWW or ftp (see Access and Use 
 constraints) or contact Barbara Emery (emery@ucar.edu ). See the WWW site 
 for additional information on accessing the data and Rules of the Road 
 procedures.
