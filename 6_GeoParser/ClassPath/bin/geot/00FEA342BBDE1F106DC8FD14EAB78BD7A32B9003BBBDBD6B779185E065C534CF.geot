BATSE Gamma-Ray Burst Data




3-D Gamma Ray Burst Light
Curves


rmfit,
the group's spectral analysis 
software, is available for download at the Fermi Science Support Center (FSSC).
The software uses IDL and Fortran, and is available as a binary
distribution (FGST-rmfit_ver33pr7.tar.gz, for linux) or to be compiled
from source (FGST_DIY-rmfit_ver33pr7.tar.gz, linux or Mac).  A tutorial
(vc_rmfit_tutorial.pdf) is also provided.


BATSE GRB Catalogs Reference: A table of the 
dates and contents of the published BATSE Burst Catalogs.
