        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The Antarctic Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) plays a crucial role in connecting 
 the atmospheric, the oceanic, and cryospheric components of the Antarctic 
 climatic system. The knowledge of the Antarctic PBL is still poor in terms of 
 theoretical understanding as well as in terms of available data. The annual 
 radiative balance is negative and therefore the air layer close to the surface 
 is cooled for  ... most of the year. In spite of low surface temperature, a regular 
 day time boundary layer evolution was observed, as well as a convective 
 activity. It became crucial to understand these processes and study processes 
 connected to the formation of the inversion wind, to investigate the 
 relationship between the surface energy balance and katabatic wind occurrence, 
 to assess the capability to detect the vertical motions associated with the 
 secondary meridional circulation, on the base of the interaction between the 
 large scale and the low level circulation, and with position of the polar 
 vortex. 
 
 Several campaigns have been carried out on the Antarctic plateau in the 
 station of Dome-C to achieve to answer to the cited problems as well as to test 
 the instrumentation to be deployed in a future long term mission. Depending on 
 the mission objective, several instruments could be included. Based on the 
 previous Antarctic experience of Sodar, but limited by the logistics two 
 vertical antenna Doppler minisodar (MS), to study the mixing layer height (MH) 
 and the associated vertical wind (W) field evolution was first deployed. A 
 three meter micromet mast (MM) with a sonic anemometer (SA) and a fast 
 hygrometer (FH) KH20 to estimate the turbulent fluxes (TF), a net radiation 
 station (NR) to calculate the radiation budget (RB), a ground temperature 
 sensors station (GT) and a flux plate (FP) to determine the energy balance (EB) 
 at the interface between the atmosphere and the snow covered soil were 
 installed. Micrometeorological tower (MT) equipped with sensors to measure the 
 wind speed and direction (WD) , air temperature (TA), humidity (RH), radiation 
 budged, soil temperature and heat fluxes were mounted. Also a microlidar (ML) 
 for the aerosols and ice particles (IP) profiling, and a passive microwave 
 radiometer (MTP-5) for the PBL temperature profiling (TP) were used.

        Quality
        
            An automatic procedure to acquire, process and store the Sodar data on line has 
 been developed. A main file (in binary format) where all information needed to 
 reconstruct the faxsimile record and an offline vertical wind field analysis is 
 provided. The other measurement systems use specific software delivered by the 
 factory when the equipment have been purchased. The re-processing of the data 
 off line is possible with a specific software package produced inside the 
 group.
