        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Report Prepared by the Missouri Department of Conservation, Jerry Presley, 
 Director, under Cooperative Agreement No. 14-45-0009-94-1019, with the National 
 Biological Service 
 
 A Missouri survey for two plant species currently being considered for listing 
 as endangered species by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service was conducted from 
 April-December, 1995. The two species surveyed were a climbing  ... milkweed, 
 Matelea baldwyniana (Sweet) Woodson, and a false foxglove, Agalinis skinneriana 
 (Wood) Britton. Sixteen sites were located for Matelea baldwyniana in five 
 counties, reducing its range in Missouri from the twelve counties it was 
 thought to occur in prior to this study. Matelea baldwyniana is restricted to 
 five counties in southwest Missouri. Although restricted to one part of the 
 state, it is now believed to be common within its range in Missouri. Agalinis 
 skinneriana was recorded from twenty-three counties prior to this study; it is 
 now known from seventeen sites in ten counties. All but one of the sites is 
 located on the prairies and large glade complexes of southwest Missouri. The 
 other site is a large glade complex in extreme eastern Missouri. Agalinis 
 skinneriana is a rare plant, and in Missouri, is restricted to high-quality 
 prairies and glades. 
 
 The purpose of this study was to determine the distribution of two plant 
 species in Missouri presently under consideration for protection under the 
 Endangered Species Act of 1973. These two species, Matelea baldwyniana (Sweet 
 Woodson and Agalinis skinneriana (Wood) Britton, are currently listed as 
 candidates (C2) for federal listing by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. 
 Matelea baldwyniana and Agalinis skinneriana were both proposed for protection 
 in 1990 (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service). At present both species are assigned 
 Missouri statuses by the Missouri Department of Conservation. Matelea 
 baldwyniana is listed as "status undetermined" (SU). Status undetermined is a 
 standing given a species that may be rare or endangered, but whose status 
 awaits further investigation before an accurate decision can be made. Agalinis 
 skinneriana is listed as a "watch list" (WL) species. Watch list is a standing 
 given to a species that is not currently rare or endangered, but whose 
 distribution is either restricted or declining and thus may soon become rare or 
 endangered. 
 
 The Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) has been tracking locations of 
 Agalinis skinneriana since 1991 and Matelea baldwyniana since 1994. Location 
 information as well as numbers of plants at a site and site characteristics are 
 stored in the Missouri Natural Heritage Database. Because MDC began tracking 
 these two species only recently, relatively few records had accumulated in the 
 Heritage Database, and more information was needed to determine their current 
 distribution and status. It was suspected at the beginning of this study that 
 both species might be secure in Missouri. This was based both on Steyermark 
 (1963), who showed both species to be well distributed in Missouri, and on 
 recent Missouri collections, which had been made without any concerted effort 
 to search for these species.

        Quality
        
            Prior to beginning fieldwork for either species, specimens 
 from various herbaria were examined for both accuracy and 
 label information. 
 Erroneous records previously in the database were corrected. 
 
 
 Sites where searches were unsuccessful are presented in the appendices 
 I and II.
