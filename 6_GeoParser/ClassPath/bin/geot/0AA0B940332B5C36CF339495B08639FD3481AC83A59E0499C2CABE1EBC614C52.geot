                            Abstract: 
                            In October 1984, the Orbiter Camera Payload System's Large Format Camera (LFC) made its maiden voyage aboard the Challenger Shuttle vehicle. The LFC was used to acquire very high resolution images of the Earth's surface. The camera system was operated via ground signal controllers. USGS EROS maintains 2,137 9x18 frames from the Large Format Camera.
