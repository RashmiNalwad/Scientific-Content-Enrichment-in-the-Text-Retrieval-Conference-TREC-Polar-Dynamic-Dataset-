        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            From the abstracts of some of the referenced papers: 
 
 Megafloral remains recovered from the Jetty Member and the upper part of the Flagstone Bench Formation, Amery Group include Dicroidium and Pagiophyllum. Dicrodium zuberi and D.crassinervis forma stelznerianum occur with Pteruchus dubius and support a Mid to Late Triassic age. A new species of conifer, Pagiophyllum papillatus, is recognised  ... along with an undetermined conifer pollen cone. 
 
 An Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition in the summer of 1989-1990 made possible a reconnaissance of the avifauna of the Prince Charles Mountains, Mac.Robertson Land, Antarctica. Sixteen scientists, scattered widely throughout the range, were moved periodically by helicopter to new sites. A staff of nine people was located at Dovers Field Base near the base of Farley Massif. These people made opportunistic observations of birds from 26 December, 1989 to 18 February, 1990. The present report summarises their collective findings. 
 
 The East Antarctic Craton contains only one substantial outcrop of Palaeozoic-Mesozoic strata between 0 and 150 degrees East; this lies in Mac.Robertson Land, on the eastern margin of the northern Prince Charles Mountains. These rocks are known as the Amery Group (Mond 1972, McKelvey and Stephenson 1990) and comprise dominantly fluviatile sandstones, with subordinate shales, coals and conglomerates. The lower formations of the Amery Group, the Radok Conglomerate and Bainmedart Coal Measures, contain a diverse Stage 5 palynomorph assemblage indicating a Baigendzhinian-Tatarian age (late Early-Late Permian), hereafter abbreviated as mid-Late Permian. The uppermost formation within the Amery Group, the Flagstone Bench Formation, was studied in detail by Webb and Fielding (1993), who revised the stratigraphy and defined a new member, the Jetty Member. They described for the first time a Triassic megaflora from this unit, considerably extending the time range for the Amery Group, which was previously regarded as entirely mid to Late Permian in age.
