                            Abstract: 
                            The Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) Level 2 data product consists of daily vertical profiles of temperature, aerosol extinciton and pressure, as well as concentrations of HCl, HF, CH4, NO by gas filter correlation radiometry and H2O, NO2, O3 and CO2 by broadband filter radiometry. The instrument measured atmospheric infrared absorption at wavelengths from 2.43 to 10.25 microns. HALOE was  ... flown on NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) to investigate upper atmosphere chemistry, dynamics and radiative processes, particlarly stratospheric ozone destruction and chlorofluromethane impact on ozone. HALOE is a solar occultation experiment which typically views 15 sunrise and sunset events each day. Limb measurements were made in the altitude range between 3 km and 130 km (depending on channel) with less than 1 km resolution. For a given day, the profiles were in two distinct latitude bands, for the sunset and sunrise events. Coverage across the full range of latitudes between 80S and 80N was achieved on a time period ranging from about two to six weeks, depending on the time of year. The HALOE Level 2 data were processed with the version 19 algorithm. 
 
 The HALOE level 2 product consists of a single granule or file per day. A data granule contains all measured HALOE species and subtypes, and ancillary information. Aerosol extinction coefficients are measured in units of 1/km, chemical species are given in mixing ratios, and temperature is in units of degrees Kelvin. HALOE level 2 data are on 491 instrument resolution altitude levels. The data files are available in a binary record oriented format.
