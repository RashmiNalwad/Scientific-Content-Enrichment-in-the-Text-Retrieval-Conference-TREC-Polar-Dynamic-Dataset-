                            Abstract: 
                            To understand the drivers and consequences of climate change on timescales important to humans, the paleoclimate of ice cores, the glacial system and local climate patterns were analysed from the Baldwin Glacier. The Baldwin Gacier serves as a reference record for an examination of the Victoria Lower Glacier. During the 99-00 season, two firn cores were recovered (12.2 and 31.1m deep). The 12.2m  ... core was used to establish a density record, the 31.1m core was sent to NZ and USA for analyses. A snow profile from 0-1.8m was cut, visually logged, the density measured and analysed for isotopic composition and chemistry. Borehole temperatures were measured. In the 00-01 season a 4m snow profile was sampled in 1cm resolution for major ion content, isotope ratios and in 5cm resolution for dust flux and beta radioactivity. Temperature, crystal geometry and density were measured on site. Contemporary snow samples during different synoptic weather conditions were sampled and dust samples from the rocky outcrops around the glacier were taken to allow the source area of the dust in the ice cores to be determined. A radiation and snow temperature flux device was installed during field work to measure incoming and outgoing radiation and the temperature at different heights in the snow pack. Hourly weather observations were recorded and glacier topography was surveyed in the the study area using differential static GPS.
