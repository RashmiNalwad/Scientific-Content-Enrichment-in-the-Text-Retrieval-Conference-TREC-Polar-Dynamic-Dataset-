        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The Magnetic Field Calculator will calculate the total magnetic field, including components (declination, inclination, horizontal intensity, northerly intensity, easterly intensity, vertical intensity) and the annual change for each. Each calculation is for a specific location, elevation and date or range of dates. The calculated result can be obtained from two separate geomagnetic models, the IGRF11 or the WMM2010. Declination is calculated using the current World Magnetic Model (WMM) or International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) model. While results are typically accurate to 30 minutes of arc, users should be aware that several environmental factors can cause disturbances in the magnetic field.     
                        

                    
                    
                        
                            

                            Purpose: 
                            The purpose of the calculators is to deliver trusted magnetic field values - past, present, and near future - to aid the public as well as the scientific community in proper navigation, positioning, and other operational and research magnetic field scenarios.
