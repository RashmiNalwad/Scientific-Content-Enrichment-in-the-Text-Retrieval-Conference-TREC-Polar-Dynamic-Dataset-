        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Ecology's Southwest Regional Office (SWRO) is concerned about nonpoint 
 and point source nutrient loading to the southern portion of Puget 
 Sound (located south of The Narrows near Tacoma). Their major concern 
 is that the past and future growth around this region may cause 
 adverse effects on water quality due to increased eutrophication. The 
  ... SWRO requested that the Environmental Investigations and Laboratory 
 Services (EILS) Program evaluate the ability of the South Sound to 
 assimilate nutrients, and if needed, recommend point source waste load 
 allocations (WLAs) and nonpoint source load allocations (LAs) for 
 controlling nutrients. 
 
 Excessive nutrient inputs can accelerate the eutrophication process 
 and affect water quality in the following ways: 1) increase the growth 
 of algae and cause shifts in community structure, leading to the 
 predominance of undesirable forms (e.g., toxic phytoplankton blooms); 
 2) alter the balance between phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish and 
 shellfish that may result in an unusually high accumulation rate of 
 organic matter on bottom sediments, which may depress bottom oxygen 
 concentrations; 3) change the aerobic bacteria populations to 
 anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria, that can poison the water column 
 with hydrogen sulfide, which may lead to further community structure 
 changes; and 4) affect recreational activities due to objectionable 
 odors, and unsightly algal mats. 
 
 The capacity of South Sound to assimilate pollutants from its drainage 
 basins is presently not well understood. The major goal of this 
 project is to develop a computer model that can be used to simulate 
 hydrodynamics and water quality, characterize and evaluate pollutant 
 loading, and identify specific point and nonpoint sources of 
 pollutants to South Sound. If needed, another goal of the project will 
 be to establish a total maximum daily load (TMDL) for waterbodies not 
 meeting standards. The TMDL will be used to regulate pollutant loads 
 and establish appropriate point source wasteload allocations (WLAs), 
 and nonpoint source load allocations (LAs). 
 
 Technical Approach Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act, requires 
 states to develop TMDLs for their waterbodies that are not meeting 
 their designated uses under technology-based pollutant 
 controls. However, Ecology has not adopted nutrient criteria or 
 recommended procedures for protecting waterbodies from excessive 
 nutrient loading. Since no site-specific or numeric nutrient criteria 
 exist for the Puget Sound, criteria must be developed to protect the 
 designated uses and water quality standards. For the South Sound, EILS 
 is proposing to develop site-specific nutrient criteria based on 
 linking measured nutrient concentrations (or loads) and an endpoint 
 indicator--i.e., dissolved oxygen concentrations. 
 
 The marine water quality standards for dissolved oxygen vary according 
 to the classification of a waterbody. The waterbody Classes AA, A, and 
 B are required to have dissolved oxygen concentrations which exceed 
 7.0, 6.0, and 5.0 mg/L, respectively, to meet state standards. In 
 addition, the following applies to all of the Classes: "When natural 
 conditions, such as upwelling, occur, causing the dissolved oxygen to 
 be depressed near or below the criterion, natural dissolved oxygen 
 levels may be degraded by up to 0.2 mg/L by human-caused activities." 
 This last condition is likely to be the endpoint indicator to link 
 changes in nutrient concentrations (loading) to water quality 
 violations which may occur in South Sound. The reason the South Sound 
 is considered a good candidate for linking the effects of nutrients to 
 dissolved oxygen concentrations and the allowable 0.2 mg/L degradation 
 is because many of the bays and inlets in the region have periods 
 (primarily in late summer) when oxygen concentrations drop below the 
 criteria. 
 
 The natural dissolved oxygen concentrations in many of the South Sound 
 waters are sometimes lower than the criteria because upwelled Pacific 
 Ocean water flowing into the Puget Sound can have naturally low 
 dissolved oxygen. Newton et al., (1997) assessed dissolved oxygen 
 concentrations in Puget Sound and suggested that bottom dissolved 
 oxygen concentrations can be exacerbated in areas that have strong 
 density stratification (e.g., in areas with freshwater input), high 
 production due to inhibited mixing, and oxidation of sunken organic 
 material (i.e., dead phytoplankton.). Eutrophication will likely have 
 the greatest impact in South Sound areas where flushing is low, where 
 strong density stratification occurs, and where phytoplankton growth 
 may be nutrient limited, such as in bays and inlets. 
 
 The following factors control nutrient enrichment, eutrophication, and 
 oxygen depletion: (1) nutrient loading rates from atmospheric 
 deposition, tributary inflows, point source discharges, nonpoint 
 source inputs (shorelands), and sediment-water exchange; (2) 
 hydrodynamic characteristics such as tides, stratification, mixing, 
 and freshwater inflow; and (3) photosynthetic characteristics and 
 processes such as light availability (season, depth), temperature, 
 growth, death, respiration, settling, and other phytoplankton 
 kinetics. 
 
 In order to determine the nutrient concentration that can be 
 assimilated into the South Sound without causing violations of the 
 endpoint target, EILS is proposing to model the waterbody. Model 
 predictions will be used to establish the nutrient criteria by 
 simulating estimated critical conditions and nutrient loading based on 
 past, present, and future water quality scenarios. 
 
 The central issues in calibrating the hydrodynamic or circulation 
 model of the South Sound will be simulating the tides, currents, and 
 salinity gradients. The pattern and motion of water in the South Sound 
 influences the distribution of dissolved oxygen. For example, 
 stratification established by light, fresh water inputs, and salty 
 Pacific Ocean water inflows may limit the vertical exchange of 
 dissolved oxygen and increase oxygen depletion in the bottom 
 waters. Although much more complicated, the circulation may also 
 affect algal productivity and the ultimate deposition and 
 decomposition of the organic mater produced from algal blooms. 
 
 The central issues in calibrating the water quality model will be 
 simulating the primary production by algae, decomposition of oxygen 
 containing material, and the concentration of dissolved 
 oxygen. Understanding the planktonic organisms, the effects of 
 nutrient enrichment, and the rates and pathways of organic matter 
 production and decomposition will determine the precision and accuracy 
 of the model to predict dissolved oxygen concentrations. 
 
 In order to predict circulation and water quality with the EFDC model 
 the suite of variables listed below will have to be determined by 
 using a combination of historical and newly collected data.

        Quality
        
            In order to improve the usefulness of the South Puget Sound Nutrient 
 Study results and focus the planning process, a Quality Assurance 
 Project Plan (QAPP) will be completed in FY99 (see Project Schedule). 
 EILS guidelines and specifications for preparing a QAPP will be 
 followed (Ecology, 1991). At a  ... minimum, the QAPP will contain a 
 review of the following elements: 
 
 1. Project description 
 2. Project objectives and goals 
 3. Study design 
 4. Data analysis and modeling 
 5. Project schedule and laboratory budget 
 6. Project organization 
 7. Data quality objectives and analytical procedures 
 8. Sampling procedures 
 
 The QAPP will discuss the data needed to calibrate and confirm the 
 EFDC model, and establish nutrient loading to the modeled area. The 
 QAPP will also discuss in more detail how the model will be used to 
 determine the potential to violate water quality criteria, and 
 recommend waste load allocations (WLAs) for point sources and load 
 allocations (LAs) for nonpoint sources of nutrients. However, 
 developing a rough calibrated EFDC model (using historical data) of 
 the South Sound will be pursued in parallel with preparing the QAPP. 
 
 An important part of defining the data quality objectives for this 
 project will be to identify what decisions and actions might be taken 
 based on the proposed study. Ecology's regional office watershed 
 managers (see Project Organization) will need to develop decision 
 statements for addressing the results of the study. The decision 
 statements should address what decisions and actions Ecology will make 
 if specific parts of South Sound are estimated to have increased algal 
 growth and reduced dissolved oxygen concentrations because of human 
 caused contributions of nutrients. EPA (1997) has identified the 
 following specific activities for developing decision statements: 
 
 Define the alternative actions that could result from resolution of 
 the principal study question. 
 
 Combine the principal study question and the alternative actions into 
 a decision statement. 
 
 If applicable, organize multiple decisions to be made by priority.
