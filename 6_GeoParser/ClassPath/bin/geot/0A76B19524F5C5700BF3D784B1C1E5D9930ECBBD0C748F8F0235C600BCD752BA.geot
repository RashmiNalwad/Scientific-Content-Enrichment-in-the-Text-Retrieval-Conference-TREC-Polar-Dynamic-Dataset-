    Description

    
         
            
            
                Laser ranging observatories are located around the world. There are 


		
            
                 three kinds of stations; fixed, movable and highly mobile. In a fixed 


		
            
                 system, the laser is permanently located at a pier or foundation that 


		
            
                 does not change position. 


		
            
                 


		
            
                 The movable systems are different. NASA operates four stations 


		
            
                 known as Mobile Laser Ranging Systems (MOBLAS), in movable 


		
            
                 locations. MOBLAS usually consist of two trailer vans which can be 


		
            
                 driven to a given observing location and set up for an observing 


		
            
                 session that will then last for months or years at that site. Because 


		
            
                 of the time-consuming setup and breakdown process, these movable 


		
            
                 systems are rarely moved. The MOBLAS at Goddard is one of three 


		
            
                 NASA SLR's located in North America. The fourth is in Yarragadee, 


		
            
                 Australia. 


		
            
                 


		
            
                 Four of the NASA stations are the highly-mobile type called 


		
            
                 Transportable Laser Ranging Systems (TLRS). They are newer 


		
            
                 systems which are smaller versions of the fixed and movable 


		
            
                 SLR systems. They are complete systems able to operate from a pad 


		
            
                 accessible by road, and require relatively short setup and breakdown 


		
            
                 times. Because of the need to sample the orbit of the retroreflector 


		
            
                 satellite, however, the duration of recording is generally measured in 


		
            
                 terms of weeks to months. These have been placed in locations such 


		
            
                 as Chile, French Polynesia, Peru and several sites in North America, 


		
            
                 Mexico and Europe. 


		
            
                 


		
            
                 The other two NASA systems are fixed systems located in Texas and 


		
            
                 Hawaii and are operated for NASA by local universities.
