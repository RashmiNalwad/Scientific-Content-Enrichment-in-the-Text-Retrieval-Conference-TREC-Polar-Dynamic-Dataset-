                            Abstract: 
                            Dry snow zones, percolation zones, wet snow zones, and blue ice patches for the 
 Antarctic continent are delineated from the 1997 Radarsat SAR image mosaic. The 
 data set is given as an ArcInfo polygon coverage in ArcInfo interchangable 
 format. The coverage is in Polar Stereographic projection with reference to 
 WGS84 ellipsoid.
