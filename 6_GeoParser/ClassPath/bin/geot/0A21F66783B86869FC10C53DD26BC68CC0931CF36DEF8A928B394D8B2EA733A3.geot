        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The CEOS Climate Diagnostics web site was inspired by the ideas and foresight of Mitchell D. Goldberg, NOAA/NESDIS, SaTellite Applications and Research (STAR), and Chief of the Satellite Meteorology and Climatology Division. Mitch is the Committee on Earth Observation Systems (CEOS) Climate Societal Benefit Area (SBA) lead and responsible for CEOS's Global Climate Observing Systems (GCOS) actions. 
  ... 
 The Working Group on Information Systems and Services (WGISS) had used the CEOS International Directory Network (IDN) to provide a portal to data through the GCOS Essential Climate Variables, in order to focus a CEOS GCOS task for CEOS agencies to make data related to these variables available. 
 
 The climate visualizations are targeted to address the Societal Benefit Areas (SBAs) related to: Disasters, Health, Energy, Climate, Water, Weather, Ecosystems, Agriculture, and Biodiversity. Every description of a climate visualization in the directory is tagged with one or more of the potentially significant Societal Benefit Areas. The visualizations are created from scientific data by a multitude of providers. The site is designed to offer visualizations that could be readily interpreted by decision makers. If a better understanding of the significance of the science can be achieved, the societal benefits of scientific research would be enhanced by providing these visualizations for long-term diagnostic analyses. The visualizations, also known as "Climate Diagnostics", are expected to be supportive and useful in decision-making processes. They have been based on the careful analysis of significant variables. Anticipating future consequences related to climate in the nine Societal Benefit Areas could be pivotal to our survival.
