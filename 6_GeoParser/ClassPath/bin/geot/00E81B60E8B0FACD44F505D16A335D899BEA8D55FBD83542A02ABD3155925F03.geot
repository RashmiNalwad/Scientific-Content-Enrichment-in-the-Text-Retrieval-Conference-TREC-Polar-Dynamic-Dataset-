        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The aims of the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) Survey are to monitor the near-surface plankton of the North Atlantic and North Sea on a monthly basis, using Continuous Plankton Recorders on a network of routes to cover the area. 
 
 Tables of month/year sampling, or a list of latitude, longitude and date of selected samples in the database can be obtained by using the 'Data Extract' link. There  ... is second trial page returning data from irregular polygons. 
 
 Spatial and temporal data are stored for every sample analyzed by the CPR survey, since 1946. This amounts to almost 170000 samples, with around 200 more samples added per month. The presence of every planktonic entity identified on each sample is stored in the database and there are almost 2 million plankton records in total. The database also contains supportive information such as tow locations, times and dates, ship details, a taxon catalogue and analyst details. 
 
 Over 400 entities have been identified on CPR samples, and the 'abundance' of each entity on each sample can be extracted from the database. Some are identified to species level, some to genus level, and some at a higher taxanomic level. Some entities are groups of other entities. A complete list is kept in the database and can be found in the Plankton List page. 
 
 Data can be extracted from user defined areas, over specified periods, for selected entities. For example, all samples taken from the Dogger Bank area in the North Sea during March April and May since 1946 could be extracted from the database, and the 'abundance' of selected diatom species on each sample could be listed. Alternatively, an average value, number of samples, and standard deviation per year per month, could be retrieved. The data can be exported to statistical and presentation packages in many popular formats such as text, rich text, comma separated, MS Excel, MS Access, MS Word, Fox Pro, Dbase, Lotus and to SQL compliant databases. SAHFOS can supply some descriptive data at little cost (usually free).

                                Description: 
                                SAHFOS is unique in having comparable data on the geographical distribution, seasonal cycles and year-to-year changes in abundance of plankton over a large spatial area. There is no other survey in the world with 76 years of marine plankton data.
 
 CPR Data are available in paper form back to 1931 and from January 1946 onwards in a computerized relational database. The database contains results from 212,014 samples with 2,542,580 taxonomic abundance entries.
 
 Analyzed sample information is entered on to an analysis sheet which is typed into the computer once the whole route is completed. These data are then scrutinized by rigorous quality control methods, before the survey database is incremented. The database then calculates the accepted mean value for the categories and applies abundance values. In 2008 a new database for the unique CPR data set will be in regular use. The advantage of this new database is that it streamlines the data input, checking and data extraction process.
