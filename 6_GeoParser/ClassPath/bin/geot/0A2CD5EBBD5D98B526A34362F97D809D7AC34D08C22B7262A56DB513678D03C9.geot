                            Abstract: 
                            A large number of saline and freshwater lakes and ponds of the Dry Valley area and crater lakes behind the McMurdo station were visited for limnological study including Lake Fryxell of the Taylor Valley, Lake Vanda, Don Juan Pond and unnamed ponds in the Labyrinth of the Wright Valley in the Dry Valleys. Water samples were collected for all the visited lakes and ponds. Measurement of the samples  ... include water temperature, pH, conductivity, inorganic nitrogen compounds, vertical distribution of nutrient matters, major and minor chemical elements and radionuclides and the size of the pond were made. Geochemical samples, such as evoporites and bottom sediments of saline ponds were collected to study the evolutional history of the saline waters in this area. To study the background level of radionulcides in the Dry Valleys, water, soil, moss and algal samples were collected. Samples were also analysed for neutron activation analysis of trace elements, measurements of the uranium content and its isotopic ratio to determine the origin of salts and the evolutionary history of the saline waters and tritium concentrations. Inorganic constituents in the lakes and ponds and their surroundings (algal, moss, lichen and soil) were studied from samples and the vertical distribution of bacteria.

            The Japanese geochemical studies in the McMurdo Dry Valleys region started in the 1963/64 field seasons when the geochemists were invited to conduct investigations in the area. Investigations continued in the area until the 1986/87 field season. The New Zealand Antarctic program supported work from the 1970/71 seasons to the 1986/87 season. 
 The extensive studies provide geochemical  ... data including general characteristics, major and trace elements, nutrients, organic matter, stable and radioisotope data and secondary minerals of lakes, ponds and their surroundings. The data is summarised in a single publications: 
 
 Torii, T. (Editor in Chief). 1994. JARE DATA REPORTS No. 199, Japanese Geochemical Data in the McMurdo Dry Valleys and on Ross Island, Antarctica. National Institute of Polar Research, Tokyo, Japan. ISSN 0075-3343 
 
 which is available online (see the GET DATA link). This publication lists all of the publications that resulted from these studies up until 1994 and contains all of the data summarised for each site.
