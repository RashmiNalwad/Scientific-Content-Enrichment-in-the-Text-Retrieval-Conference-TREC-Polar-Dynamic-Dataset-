        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            WAIS Divide Core 06A 68,000 years ago through 2000C.E. 
 Isotope Data from University of Washington (Eric Steig). 
 
 Data set of 0.25 to 1 meter averages of oxygen isotope data from the WAIS Divide ice core. 
 The full data set produced by Eric Steig, Andrew Schauer, Peter Neff Spruce Schoenemann, Bradley Markle, Rebecca Teel, Beth VanDen Heuvel,Kyle Samek at the University of Washington Isolab,  ... (http://depts.washington.edu/isolab)					 
 
 How to cite these data.					 
 1) This full data set was published in the following paper: 
 WAIS Divide Project Members. Precise interpolar phasing of abrupt climate change during the last ice age. Nature, in press (2015). 
 
 Where possible, please also cite the following papers when using these data. 
 					 
 2) The most recent 2000 years of these data were first published in: 
 Steig, E.J. et al., Recent climate and ice-sheet changes in West Antarctica compared 
 with the past 2000 years. Nature Geoscience 6: 372-375, doi:10.1038/ngeo1778 (2013). 
 					 
 
 3) The most recent 30000 years of these data were first published in:					 
 WAIS Divide Project Members. Onset of deglacial warming in West Antarctica driven 
 by local orbital forcing. Nature 500: 440-444, doi:10.1038/nature12376 (2013). 
 					 
 4) Development of the WD2014 timescale is described in: 
 Buizert, C. et al., The WAIS-Divide deep ice core WD2014 chronology -- Part 1: Methane 
 synchronization (68-31 ka BP) and the gas age-ice age difference. Climate of the Past, 11: 153-173, 
 doi:10.5194/cp-11-153-2015 (2015).					 
 					 
 All isotope data (d18O) in per mil, normalized to the IAEA VSMOW/SLAP scale. 
 See Schoenemann et al., doi:10.1002/rcm.6486 (2014), for discussion of isotope-ratio normalization methods. 
 
 Precision and accuracy  All ages are given in years before 1950.0 C.E. (A.D.) on the WD2014 timescale.
