                    Project Description

                    
                        
                            U.S. GLOBEC (GLOBal ocean ECosystems dynamics, http://www.usglobec.org/) is a 

 research program organized by oceanographers and fisheries scientists to 

 address the question of how global climate change may affect the abundance and 

 production of animals in the sea. The U.S. GLOBEC Program currently has major 

 research efforts underway in the Georges Bank / Northwest Atlantic Region, and 

 the Northeast Pacific (with components in the California Current and in the 

 Coastal Gulf of Alaska). 

 

 U.S. GLOBAL OCEAN ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS, GEORGES BANK 

 

 The U.S. GLOBEC Georges Bank Program is a large multidisciplinary multi-year 

 oceanographic effort. The proximate goal is to understand the population 

 dynamics of key species on the Bank - Cod, Haddock, and two species of 

 zooplankton - in terms of their coupling to the physical environment and in 

 terms of their predators and prey. The ultimate goal is to be able to predict 

 changes in the distribution and abundance of these species as a result of 

 changes in their physical and biotic environment as well as to anticipate how 

 their populations might respond to climate change. 

 

 The effort is substantial, requiring 

 -broad-scale surveys of the entire Bank, and 

 -process studies which focus both on 

 -the links between the target species and their physical environment, and 

 -the determination of fundamental aspects of these species' life history 

 (birth rates, growth rates, death rates, etc). 

 

 Equally important are the modelling efforts that are ongoing which seek to 

 provide realistic predictions of the flow field and which utilize the life 

 history information to produce an integrated view of the dynamics of the 

 populations.
