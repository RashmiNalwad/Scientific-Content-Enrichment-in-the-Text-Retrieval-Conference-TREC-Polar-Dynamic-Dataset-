Hello,

I am looking at the Carder case 2 chlorophyll-a algorithm from MODIS ATBD 19. I could find all the data used in the algorithm development (Table 5) except "MF0796" in SeaBASS. Is that data missing or just not made available?

Thanks

Greetings.  SeaBASS does not include data from the MF0796 campaign.  Sorry we can't help more.

Best,

  Jeremy
