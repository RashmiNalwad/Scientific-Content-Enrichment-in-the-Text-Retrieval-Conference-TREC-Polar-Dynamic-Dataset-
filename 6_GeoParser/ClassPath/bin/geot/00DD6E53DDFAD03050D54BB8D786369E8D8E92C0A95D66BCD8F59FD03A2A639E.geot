        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            A survey of the epibenthic fauna of hard-substrata was made around Casey Station, using a camera mounted on a frame to take photoquadrats. A nested dsampling desing was used with several spatial scales. At each location there were two sites, approximately 50-100 m apart. At each site there were three by 15 m long transects, approximately 5 m apart. On each transect there were 2 plots, 5 m long by  ... 2 m wide. Six photoquadrats were taken in each plot. This metadata record describes one compnent of this survey, photoquadrats taken in and around boulders and boulder fields. One of the aims of this survey was to determine if there is any evidence of human impacts in these assemblages. There were several control and several potentially impacted locations. 
 
 The data have yet to be analysed.
