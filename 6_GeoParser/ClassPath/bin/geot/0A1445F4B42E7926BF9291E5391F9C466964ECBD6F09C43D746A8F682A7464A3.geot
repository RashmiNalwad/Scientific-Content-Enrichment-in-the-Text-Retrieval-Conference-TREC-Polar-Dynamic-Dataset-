            Abstract: 
            The Aquaculture Network Information Center (AquaNIC) is a gateway to
the world's electronic aquaculture resources. AquaNIC is coordinated
by the Mississippi-Alabama Sea Grant Consortium, and hosted by Purdue
University and the University of Illinois through the Illinois-Indiana
Sea Grant College Program. AquaNIC is a member of the National Sea
Grant College Program's Network of Aquaculture Information Services
along with the DOC/NOAA Aquaculture Information Center, National Sea
Grant Library, Delaware Aquaculture Resource Center, and Maryland Sea
Grant Program.

AquaNIC also maintains the aquaculture subject area for the
Agriculture Network Information Center, an alliance between the
National Agricultural Library (NAL), university librarians, and
subject matter specialists at Land Grant and Sea Grant institutions.
AquaNIC collaborators include: the NAL's Alternative Farming Systems
Information Center, The Gateway to Educational Materials, Auburn
University's Department of Fisheries and Allied Aquaculture, Kentucky
State University, Maine Sea Grant/Cooperative Extension, the
University of Arizona, the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, the
University of California Davis, the University of Florida Tropical
Aquaculture Center, the University of Idaho Cooperative Extension
Service, Texas A&M University, Thad Cochran National Warmwater
Aquaculture Center, and Virginia State University.
