                    Project Description

                    
                        
                            The SPECMAP Project contains climatic time series of the past 

 400,000 years, as well as basic downcore and core-top data from 

 which these time series are derived. Downcore records include 

 (1) quantitative data on planktonic species and assemblages 

 which reflect conditions in the surface waters of the Atlantic 

 Ocean; (2) estimates of sea-surface temperature derived from 

 these faunal data; and (3) measurements of O-18, C-13 difference 

 (planktic and benthic), and Cd/Ca. The age model used to 

 transform each downcore record into a time series by correlation 

 of its O-18 record with the published O-18 chronology of Imbrie 

 et al. (1984) is given. Time series with uniformly spaced 

 samples may be calculated by linear interpolation. The O-18 

 chronologies of Imbrie et al. (1984) and Martinson et al. 

 (1987) are given for reference, as well as orbital time series 

 taken from the work of Berger (1978a,b). Also archived are 

 N. G. Kipp's Atlantic core-top foraminiferal data and SST 

 equations FA20 and UW7 derived from them by procedures described 

 in Kipp (1976).
