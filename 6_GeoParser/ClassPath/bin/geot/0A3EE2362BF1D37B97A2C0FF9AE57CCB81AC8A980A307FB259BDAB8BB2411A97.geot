                            Abstract: 
                            The Project for Risk Evaluation, Vulnerability Indexing and Early Warning ( 
 PREVIEW-IMS) tool allows users to visualize earthquakes, fires, floods, 
 cyclones and tsunamis, in relation with other layers of information such as: 
 cities, national parks, rivers, components of vulnerability, population 
 density, Human Development Index, Gross Domestic Products, elevation and 
 landcover. Users may perform zooms, pan to a particular area, add different 
 layers of general data including cities, national parks, etc. Different 
 backgrounds can be chosen to highlight different components reflecting 
 vulnerability, such as population density, Human Development Index (HDI) or the 
 Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
