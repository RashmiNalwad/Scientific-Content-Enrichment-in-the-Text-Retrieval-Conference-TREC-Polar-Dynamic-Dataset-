      Already have a NASA/NDC account?

        
          NASA employees, support service contractors, and affiliates with NASA accounts may use their NDC accounts to register to NEX. This is the username/password you use to login to your NASA computers. Some centers do not have NDC accounts yet, in which case you may want to consider using OpenID (the user privileges are the same). An account profile that you can fill out will automatically be created when you login with your NDC credentials here, no additional approvals required. 
        
    

    
    
      OR

    

    
    Use Open ID (what's this?)

      
        Non-NASA users can utilize OpenID to login to NEX. OpenID allows you to utilize an email account username/password that you already own (gmail, yahoo, aol) to login to NEX, rather than creating a new username/password combination for the site. If you don't have any of those accounts, you can create a verisign account instead.

When you click your preferred provider below, you will be prompted to enter your credentials for that site and information about your research interests and connection to NASA (please be thorough, this helps hasten our approval process). NEX will then generate an email to that account. You must follow the link in the email to verify your identity (check your spam filters if you don't receive it, or use the Contact Us feature to let us know). Your application will then enter our approval process. Once approved (usually within 48 hours), you'll receive email verification letting you know.

            Would you prefer to login using your PayPal Account? If you would please contact us and let us know.
        

        
            As of July 24th 2013 Yahoo is no longer a supported OpenID provider. If you have any questions please contact us and let us know.
        

    

    
   Having trouble logging in?

    
      
        Make sure that:

        	No "NDC\" is included in front of your username
	You use the same username/password that you use to login to NASA computers. It is NOT your Idmax or any other credentials
	You use the same OpenID provider that you first registered with
