        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has released the new HAZUS99, the natural hazard loss estimation methodology software program. HAZUS99 is used for earthquake-related mitigation, emergency preparedness, response and recovery planning, and has been significantly enhanced for use as a tool during disaster response operations. HAZUS99, implemented through PC-based geographic information  ... system (GIS) software, is a nationally applicable, standardized method for estimating earthquake losses at the community or regional level. 
 
 HAZUS 99 gives disaster response personnel the ability to generate a loss/damage estimate immediately following a disaster. This estimate can be updated as actual damage or loss data is gathered during field reconnaissance following an earthquake. In addition, HAZUS99 includes the ability to automatically generate and analyze a study region based on data downloaded from REDI-CUBE, a real-time earthquake reporting system in California. 
 
 Methodology improvements in HAZUS99 include sophisticated potable water network analysis capability; analysis of multiple fault segments; 3-D fault modeling; and the latest advances for estimating bridge damage. In response to user requests, HAZUS99 permits saving work in progress. 
 
 HAZUS99 incorporates updated USGS97 Fault Maps, new national databases for bridges, potable water pipelines and railway tracks, an improved hospital database, and an updated EPA HAZMAT database. 
 
 HAZUS99, which replaces HAZUS97, is available on CD-ROM in three editions for Eastern U.S., Central U.S. and Western U.S. Each HAZUS99 CD-ROM includes the Computer-based Tutorial (CBT) and the Inventory Collection Tool (InCAST). HAZUS99 CD-ROMs may be ordered by going to the "HAZUS Ordering Information" section of this website.
