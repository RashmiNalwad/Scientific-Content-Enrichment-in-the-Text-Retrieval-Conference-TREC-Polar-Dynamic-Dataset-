        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            This data set contains monthly mean and monthly climatological mean 
 wind stresses (dynes/cm**2), wind stress curl (dynes/cm**3), and 
 Sverdrup transport stream functions and Sverdrup transport 
 anomalies (gm/s) for the years 1980 through 1986. The data are given on a 
 2.5 X 2.5 lat/lon grid based upon twice-daily 1000 mb wind analyses from 
 the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts  ... (ECMWF) obtained 
 from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) archive. The data 
 set consists of (level III) global gridded data consisting of the 
 following variables: wind stress in the x direction (STRESS_X), wind 
 stress in the y direction (STRESS_Y), total wind stress (STRESS_T), 
 wind stress curl (CURL), Sverdrup transport and Sverdrup transport 
 anomalies (SVERD_T), and mean sea ice/land coverage. The data set 
 consists of data covering the global oceans excluding those areas 
 climatologically covered with ice. The twice-daily 1000 mb ECMWF 
 wind analyses were chosen for the wind stress analysis instead of the 
 conventional ship data for its better coverage and temporal 
 sampling. The ECMWF analysis was used over the National Meteorology Center 
 (NMC) analysis for its ability to adequately analyze the Southern 
 Hemisphere and for its completeness (i.e. no missing field problems and 
 corrupt fields that occasionally plague the NMC analyses).
