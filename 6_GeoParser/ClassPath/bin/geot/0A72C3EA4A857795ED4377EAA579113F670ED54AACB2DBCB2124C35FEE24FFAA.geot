                            Abstract: 
                            The United Nations Platform for Space-based information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response (UN-SPIDER) aims at providing universal access to all types of space-based information and services relevant to disaster management by being a gateway to space information for disaster management support; serving as a bridge to connect the disaster management and space communities; and being a facilitator of capacity-building and institutional strengthening.
