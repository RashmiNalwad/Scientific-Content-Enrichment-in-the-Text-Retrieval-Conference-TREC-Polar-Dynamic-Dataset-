                            Taken from sections of the report: 
 
 Introduction 
 
 This report details the survey work carried out on Macquarie Island during January of 1996 by AUSLIG on behalf of Australian Antarctic Divisions Mapping Program. The principle aim of this work was to acquire aerial photography of the island so that a new topographic map of the island can be produced. A number of other tasks were also carried out.  ... In the following pages each task will be dealt with in terms of the technique employed and the results achieved. The survey work was carried out by the following people : 
 
 Paul Boland Tasmania Department of Environment and Land Management, 
 Troy Lee Antarctic Division Volunteer, 
 Stuart Smith Antarctic Division Volunteer, 
 Roger Handsworth Platypus Engineering, 
 Noel Ward AUSLIG. 
 
 This report does not cover the specifics of the work carried out by Paul Boland or Roger Handsworth, that being the subject of separate reports to be submitted by them. 
 
 Time Frame 
 
 The Macquarie Island survey field party departed Hobart at 3pm on Thursday 4th of January 1996 aboard MV Polar Bird, voyage 3.1 of the Antarctic re-supply season. Voyage 3.1 arrived at Macquarie island at about 5am eastern summer time (UT+11) on Sunday 7th of January 1996. The survey party departed Macquarie Island on 12th of January aboard MV Polar Bird, voyage 3.1, at about 0:50am local time. Voyage 3.1 returned to Hobart on Sunday the 14th of January. All passengers where disembarked at about 6pm that day. 
 
 Aim and Project Brief 
 
 The survey program, as detailed by Antarctic Division in its Brief to Surveyors, comprised the following tasks, this document is included as Appendix A 
 
 1. Attempt aerial photography of the whole island, 
 2. Mark the boundaries of the Historic Zone and Zone A in the vicinity of the Isthmus, 
 3. Field check the new station facilities information system, including the location of all masts, antennae, guys and walkways. 
 4. Positioning of ERS-1 and 2 corner cube reflectors, 
 5. Precise levelling, 
 6. Fix, by GPS, survey marks AUS 157 and AUS 158. 
 7. Precise GPS connection from the ARGN site to the Hurd Point Tide Gauge site.

 AUSLIG is now known as Geoscience Australia. 
 
 Aerial Photography 
 Yet another unsuccessful attempt. If aerial photography of this island is to be considered a priority  ... for the Mapping Program's support of the scientific community it is evident that a different approach is required. Attempting to acquire systematic coverage of this island during a four or five day resupply visit will always be a high risk activity owing to the brevity of the stay and the emphasis given to cargo operations. Possible options include : 
 
 - Leaving suitably equipped aircraft on the island for a short season, 
 - During a short ship visit placing one of the aircraft under the control of the mapping program so that cargo operations do not compromise attempts at aerial photography, 
 - Engage a contractor to acquire photography on a 'pay on results' basis. 
 
 As all who visit Macquarie Island know there is persistent low level cloud over all or some of the island every day of the year. Under such conditions it is optimistic to expect to photograph the island in one mission during a four day visit let alone when cargo operations are being undertaken. If aircraft were dedicated to the aerial photography it would be possible to &nibble at it& as the weather allowed and without having to install the photography system ( 1-2 hrs work ) every time the aircraft became available. 
 
 General 
 Some of the survey team were based on the ship which, with the uncertainty of their arrival and departure times, compromised the whole teams productivity owing to the need for both parties to work together. 
 
 The loss of the first day to helicopter operations owing to barge operations also impacted on the amount of work carried out, as only three survey personnel and a small quantity of equipment went ashore in the afternoon of that day. It is also worth noting that the first day of the re-supply was blessed with fly-able weather.
