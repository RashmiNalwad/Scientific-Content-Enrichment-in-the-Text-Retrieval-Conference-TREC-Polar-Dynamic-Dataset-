        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The sea ice data are the SMMR/SMMI data for the period 1978-96. These are in the form of daily (or bi-diurnal) concentration amounts on a regular grid. The data on the extratropical cyclones has been obtained using the automatic algorithm of Simmonds and Keay (2000, Journal of Climate, 873-885). This algorithm was applied to the NCEP reanalysis product for the period 1978-96. 
 
 In this project, sea  ... ice data were sourced from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (CIRES, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309-0449, USA). The NCEP reanalysis data set was sourced from: NOAA/ National Weather Service, National Centers for Environmental Prediction (5200 Auth Road, Camp Springs, Maryland, 20746 USA). 
 
 The sea ice concentration data used were for the Antarctic only (the entire Antarctic sea ice domain). Data started in 1978. All data were collected by satellite. A link to a metadata record for these data are available from the URL given below. 
 
 Two NCEP reanalysis data sets were used in this study. The first was NCEP/NCAR, with 6-hourly data available from 1958 (see the URL provided below for further information). The second was the NCEP/DOE set, with 6-hourly data available from 1979 (see the URL provided below for further information). 
 
 In this project the following model/analysis was applied: 
 
 Application of The University of Melbourne cyclone tracking scheme (Simmonds et al., 2003, Monthly Weather Review, 131, 272-288) and a broad range of statistical tests. Brief details are provided in the Summary. See the link for the pdf document for more detailed information. 
 
 These complex statistical analyses were run over the entire length of the project (1998/99 - 2000/01). They were run on the Sun Workstation cluster in the School of Earth Sciences, The University of Melbourne.
