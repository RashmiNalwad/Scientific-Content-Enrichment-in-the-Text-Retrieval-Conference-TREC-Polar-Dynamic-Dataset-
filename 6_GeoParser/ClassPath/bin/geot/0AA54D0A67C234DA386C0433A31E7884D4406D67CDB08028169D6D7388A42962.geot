        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The PDRS (Polar Data Reference Set) is a subset of the Seasat Altimeter sensor 
 data record (SDR) archive maintained at the ADF (Algorithm Development 
 Facility), part of the EODC (Earth Observation Data Centre). The aim was to 
 provide a manageable set of polar waveforms for R&D analysis. The PDRS covers 
 a 17-day repeat period from 24th July 1978 to 11th August 1978. 
 
 Seasat was launched on  ... 28th June 1978 carrying a five-sensor payload. The 
 objective of the Altimeter (ALT) was to determine ocean topography with a 
 height measurement precision of 10 cm. The ALT carrier frequency was 13.5 GHz 
 and operated in chirp pulse mode with a 3.2 micro-second uncompressed pulse 
 width and 3.125 ns compressed pulse width. The pulse limited footprint 
 diameter was 1.2 km for calm seas; beam-limited footprint diameter was 22.2 
 km. 
 
 The PDRS is sub-divided into four data types: i) Antarctic ice sheet data, 
 ii) Antarctic sea ice data, iii) Greenland ice sheet data, and iv) Arctic sea 
 ice data. 
 
 The source of the PDRS data set was 36 tapes comprising the SDR waveform data 
 for a 17-day repeat period. The data points of interest fall in two distinct 
 geographic regions: south of -50 and north of 59 latitudes. In the southern 
 region, all data with the TOIL flag set to land were extracted as Antarctic 
 ice sheet data. In the northern region, all data with the TOIL flag set to 
 land within Greenland (longitudes -58 W and -20 W) were extracted as Greenland 
 ice sheet data 
 
 The remaining sets of sea ice data were extracted using an algorithm based on 
 the peakiness of the waveform which was developed by the Remote Sensing Group 
 at Mullard Space Science Laboratories, UK. 
 
 The tapes are written in 9-track, 6250-bpi format. The block format is that 
 described in the Seast Telemetry dictionary, containing 23 waveforms packed 
 into 2988 2-byte words. Each tape is divided into logical files separated by 
 a file mark, one per source tape. 
 
 Full tape copies will be made of this data set on request. Tape handling 
 costs will be charged.
