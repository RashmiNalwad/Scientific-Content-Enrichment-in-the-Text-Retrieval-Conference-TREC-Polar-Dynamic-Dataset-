                            Abstract: 
                            The Global Land Cover Facility (GLCF) at the University of Maryland, College 
 Park houses Digital Globe Quickbird imagery for public use. 
 
 QuickBird imagery is a fine resolution remotely sensed product available to the 
 public through DigitalGlobe. Four multi-spectral bands approximate Landsat and 
 other commercial fine resolution sensors,  ... but is provided at 2.4 m resolution. 
 The panchromatic band is available at .71 meters. QuickBird is valuable imagery 
 for validation and land cover assessment. 
 
 The sensor characteristics of QuickBird make it suited for capturing protected 
 area dynamics. Degradation in the viability of protected areas often begins at 
 a resolution not detectable by lower resolution instruments. In addition, the 
 recovery of protected areas following a critical disturbance such as the 
 December 2004 tsunami is best captured at very high resolution.
