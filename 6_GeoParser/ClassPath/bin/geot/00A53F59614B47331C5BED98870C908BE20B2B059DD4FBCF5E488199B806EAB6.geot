    Description

    
         
            
            
                The Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 


		
            
                 is a technique used for the in situ analysis of trace elements 


		
            
                 in solid samples. It can determine many elements in the periodic 


		
            
                 table to high degrees of accuracy and precision. The technique 


		
            
                 complements electron microprobe analysis, typically measuring 


		
            
                 trace elements at a lower concentration range (1 ppb - 100 ppm). 


		
            
                 


		
            
                 Solid particles are physically ablated due to the interaction of 


		
            
                 a high power (> 1 x 1010 Wcm-2) laser beam with the surface of 


		
            
                 the sample. The particles are carried in a stream of inert gas 


		
            
                 (helium or argon) into an argon plasma where they are ionized 


		
            
                 before measurement in a quadruple mass spectrometer. Isotopes 


		
            
                 are measured to determine elemental concentrations.
