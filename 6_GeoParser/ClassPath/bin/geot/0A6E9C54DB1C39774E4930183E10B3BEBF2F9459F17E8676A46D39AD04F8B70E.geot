        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            This data set consists of global temperature reconstruction based on glacier 
 length records from 169 locations. 
 
 A temperature history for different parts of the world was constructed from 169 
 glacier length records. Using a first-order theory of glacier dynamics, 
 changes in glacier length were related to changes in temperature. The derived 
 temperature histories are fully independent of proxy and instrumental data 
 used in earlier reconstructions. Moderate global warming started in the middle 
 of the 19th century. The reconstructed warming in the first half of the 20th 
 century is 0.5 kelvin. This warming was notably coherent over the globe. The 
 warming signals from glaciers at low and high elevations appear to be very 
 similar.
