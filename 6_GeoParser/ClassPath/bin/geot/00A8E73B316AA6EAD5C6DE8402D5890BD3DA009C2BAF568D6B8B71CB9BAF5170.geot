                            Abstract: 
                            The GOES Solar X-ray Imager is integrated into the GOES-12 satellite, whose primary mission is to provide Earth-weather monitoring. The SXI is operated by NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS). NOAA's Space Environment Center (SEC) receives the telemetry stream directly from SXI, processes the data, and integrates the observations into their space weather alert and forecast services. The data are sent in real time to NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) where they are immediately made available to the public, and preserved in a secure archive for future research.SXi was launched in with GOES-M on Juy 23, 2001 Post Launch Test data were available from August - December 2001.SXI officially entered operations in April 2003.     
                        

                    
                    
                        
                            

                            Purpose: 
                            The Solar X-ray Imager (SXI) is used to determine when to issue forecasts and alerts of 'space weather' conditions that may interfere with ground and space systems. These conditions include ionospheric changes that affect radiocommunication (both ground-to-ground and satellite-to-ground) and magnetospheric variations that induce currents in electric power grids and long distance pipelines and can  ... cause navigational errors in magnetic guidance systems, introduce changes in spacecraft charging, produce high energy particles that can cause single event upsets in satellite circuitry, and expose astronauts to increased radiation. SXI will observe solar flares, solar active regions, coronal holes, and coronal mass ejections. Images from SXI will be used by NOAA andU.S. Air Force forecasters to monitor solar conditions that affect space weather conditions that are used to describe the dynamic environment of energetic particles, solar wind streams, and coronal mass ejections emanating from the Sun. The SXI, performing as a part of the Space Environment Monitor (SEM)instruments, provides the means for obtaining the solar data required to: Locate coronal holes for predicting high speed solar wind streams causing recurrent geomagnetic storms, and also locate transient coronal holes as a source of ejecta.Locate flares on the disk and beyond the west limb for proton event warnings. Monitor for changes indicating coronal mass ejections (CME) that may impact Earth and cause geomagnetic storms. Large-scale, long duration, possible weakly emitting events, and brightening of coronal filament arcades are usedas evidence of CMEs.Observe active region size morphology and complexity, and temperature and emissions measure, for flare forecasts. Monitor for active regions beyond eastlimb that will be rotating onto the solar disk.Other solar feature observations include flare properties, newly emerging active regions, X-ray bright points, and following CME ejecta at 1000 km/sec. To meet these objectives, the SXI images the solar corona in the soft X-ray to extreme ultraviolet (XUV) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Full-disk solar images are provided with a 512 X 512 array with 5 arcsec pixels in several wavelength bands from 6 to 60 E (0.6 to 6 nm). A regular sequence of exposures that are downlinked at one-minute intervals is used to cover the full dynamic range needed to monitor solar activity. The SXI telescope is mounted on the X-ray Positioner (XRP), and its associated electronics boxes are on the solar array yoke of the GOES-M spacecraft. The SXI is Government-furnished equipment.
