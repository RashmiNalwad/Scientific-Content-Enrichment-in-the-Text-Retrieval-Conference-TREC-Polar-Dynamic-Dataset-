	Description:
	
                  	Abstract:
	
                        
                        MISR (Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer) views the sunlit Earth simultaneously at nine widely spaced and collects global
                        images with high spatial detail in four colors at every angle. These images are carefully calibrated to provide accurate measures
                        of the brightness, contrast, and color of reflected sunlight. The change in reflection at different view angles affords the
                        means to distinguish different types of atmospheric particles (aerosols), cloud forms, and land surface covers. Combined with
                        stereoscopic techniques, this enables construction of 3-dimensional models and more accurate estimates of the total amount
                        of sunlight reflected by Earth's diverse environments.MISR was built for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It is part
                        of NASA's Terra spacecraft, launched into a polar orbit around the Earth on December 18, 1999.The Southern African Fire Atmosphere
                        Research Initiative (SAFARI) 2000 field campaign focused on the smoke and gases released into the environment of southern
                        Africa by industrial, biological, and man-made sources such as biomass burning. The area of study and MISR path numbers include
                        Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. These MISR data cover the period
                        August 12 through September 28, 2000.
