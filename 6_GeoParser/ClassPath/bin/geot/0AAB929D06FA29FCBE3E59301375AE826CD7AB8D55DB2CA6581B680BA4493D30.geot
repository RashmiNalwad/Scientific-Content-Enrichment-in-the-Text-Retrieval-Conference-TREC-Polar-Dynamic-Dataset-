        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            This data set consists of global ocean calcite (CLCT) data derived from the 
 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in orbit on the Aqua 
 (formerly EOS PM) platform. MODIS ocean products are processed and 
 distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). Processing details 
 can be found at http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/DOCS/MODISA_processing.html 
 
 Coccolithophores are  ... small marine phytoplankton which form external CaCO3 
 scales (diameter ~ a few m and thickness 250 to 750 nm) called coccoliths. The 
 coccoliths can form multiple layers and eventually detach. Coccolithophores are 
 the largest source of calcium carbonate on earth [Westbroek et al., 1985]. 
 Dissolution of calcite depends on the depth of the calcite compensation depth. 
 Globally, calcium carbonate is responsible for about 75% of the deposition of 
 carbon on the sea floor having a marine origin [Groom and Holligan, 1987; 
 Honjo, 1986; Honjo, 1990], and exceeds organic burial by a factor of seven. 
 Thus, coccolith production is an important part of the biogenic carbon cycle. 
 
 A global-scale study of their distribution is an important application for 
 MODIS imagery. MODIS is ideal for such a study because of two unique 
 characteristics: first its high radiometric sensitivity should, in principle, 
 allow the detection of smaller quantities of coccoliths than CZCS; and second, 
 the existence of the land bands on MODIS, e.g., band 3 and 4, with their high 
 saturation radiance will enable study of very high concentrations of coccoliths 
 that would saturate a typical ocean color instrument. The Aqua MODIS Level-3 
 calcite products are generated routinely for daily, 8-day, monthly, seasonal 
 and annual time periods. Spatial resolutions of 4 and 9 km are available. 
 
 The algorithm for extracting the detached coccolith concentration from surface 
 waters is based on the semianalytic model of ocean color of Gordon et al. 
 [1988]. Briefly, the model relates the normalized water-leaving radiance, i.e., 
 the radiance that would exit the ocean if the sun were at the zenith and the 
 atmosphere were removed [Gordon and Clark, 1981], to the absorption and 
 scattering properties of the constituents of the water using radiative transfer 
 theory. The absorption and scattering properties are then related to the 
 constituent concentrations through statistical analysis of direct measurements. 
 Therefore, they represent oceanic- or regional-averaged relationships.
