                            Abstract: 
                            The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) is devised by 
 Palmer (1965) to represent the severity of dry and wet spells 
 over the U.S. based on monthly temperature and precipitation 
 data as well as the soil-water holding capacity at that 
 location. These data consist of the monthly PDSI over global 
 land areas from 1860-1995 derived using monthly surface air 
 temperature (from Hansen and Lebedeff, 1987 and updates) 
 and precipitation (from Dai et al., 1997) data. Soil-holding 
 capacity was fixed to climatological maps from 
 Webb et al. (1993). More details can be found in 
 Dai, et al. (1998).
