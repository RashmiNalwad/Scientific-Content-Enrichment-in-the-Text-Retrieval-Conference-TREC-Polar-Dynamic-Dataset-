                            Abstract: 
                            This dataset includes CTD measurements of open water and fjords of Antarctic Peninsula during the KARP (Korea Antarctic Research Program) cruise from 1998 to 2006. Data obtained are water temperature, salinity, density, dissolved oxygen concentration, turbidity, chlorophyl a, and current velocity. For fjord surveys, tide gauge was moored over the year with temperature and conductivity sensors.
