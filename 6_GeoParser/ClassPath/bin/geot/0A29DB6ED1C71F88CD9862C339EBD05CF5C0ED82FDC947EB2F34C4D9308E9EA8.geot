                    Service Provider Description

                    
                        
                            The mission of the University of Alaska Fairbanks is to serve as the premier 

 university in arctic and subarctic research and teaching. The Water and 

 Environmental Research Center (WERC) fills that role in scientific and 

 engineering studies related to water resources and environmental quality. 

 WERCs mission is to perform basic and applied research related to water and 

 environmental resources, to train graduate students at master's and PhD levels 

 in this field, and to disseminate pertinent research information to the public. 

 WERCs research budget currently runs around $1.2 million per year; graduate 

 education is acquired through student participation in various research 

 projects. Funding is obtained from state and federal agencies as well as from 

 private companies and foundations. Faculty, staff, and students at WERC are 

 working to develop a better understanding of the arctic and subarctic 

 environments. Research disciplines at WERC include environmental, civil, and 

 mechanical engineering; oceanography; limnology; hydrology; microbiology; 

 geochemistry; and hydraulics. WERC scientists are conducting cutting-edge 

 research to help improve the quality of life for arctic inhabitants while 

 supporting careful and sustainable development of Alaska's bountiful natural 

 resources, protecting fragile ecosystems, and seeking to better understand the 

 role of the arctic and subarctic in the global system.
