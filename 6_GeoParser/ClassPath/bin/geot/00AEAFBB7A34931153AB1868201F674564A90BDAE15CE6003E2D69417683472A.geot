        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            As seabirds emperor penguins spent a large proportion of their lives at sea. For food they depend entirely on marine resources. Young penguins rarely return to their natal colonies after their first year. Satellite tracking will give us insights into where foraging areas may be that are important for these birds. This tracking work is part of a multi-species study funded by the Integrated Marine Observation System (IMOS). 
 
 These data are from penguins from the Amanda Bay area, and for the 2010-2011 season.     
                        

                    
                    
                        
                            

                            Purpose: 
                            To determine the at-sea distribution of fledgling emperor penguins and to examine to which extent their foraging range may overlap with that of other species.
