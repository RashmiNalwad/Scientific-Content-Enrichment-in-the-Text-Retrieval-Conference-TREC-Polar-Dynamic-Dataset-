        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            This data set contains hydrologic units (drainage basins) at a scale of 1:2,000,000 for the conterminous United States and Alaska. The attributes assigned to each unit follow the 8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) scheme, which has been approved as a Federal Information Processing Standard. The following example shows the four levels of classification, code, and description of a typical  ... 8-digit HUC: 
 
 Classification Level Code Description 
 -------------------- -------- -------------------------- 
 Region 04 Great Lakes 
 Subregion 0403 Northwestern Lake 
 Michigan 
 Accounting Unit 040302 Fox River Basin, 
 Wisconsin 
 Catalog Unit 04030203 Lake Winnebago, 
 Wisconsin 
 
 The following procedures were used to compile the 1:2,000,000-scale hydrologic unit data set: 
 
 Individual 1:500,000-scale State Hydrologic Unit maps, in a Lambert Conformal Conic Projection, were photo-reduced to 1:2,000,000 scale. The reduced maps were edge matched and combined to form 20 sections coincident with 1:2,000,000-scale National Atlas boundaries. 
 
 Hydrologic unit boundaries were digitized from the photo-reduced maps; digitized line work was then compared to both the original source materials and U.S. Geological Survey 1:2,000,000-scale digital line graph (DLG) drainage maps to verify the accuracy of of the digitized lines. Attribute codes, which were assigned to each hydrologic unit, were also verified. 
 
 Sections were then combined into two files with one file containing coverage of the conterminous United States and the other file containing coverage of Alaska. Outermost hydrologic unit boundaries were extended beyond coastlines and U.S. boundaries to allow users to clip data using their own digital U.S. boundary files. 
 
 The EROS Data Center (EDC) has clipped the Hydrologic Unit data using an EDC-modified 1:2,000,000-scale DLG boundary file. The EDC distributes this version as well as the unclipped version of the data. These data are available from the EDC in the following formats: 
 
 Data Form Projection Media Type 
 Coverage 
 -------------- ------ -------------------------- ---------- 
 ------------- 
 Unclipped Vector Albers Equal Area Mag Tape Co. 
 U.S. & AK 
 Clipped by EDC Vector Lambert Azimuthal Eq. Area Mag Tape Co. 
 U.S. Only 
 " Vector " CD-ROM 
 " 
 " Raster " Mag Tape 
 " 
 " Raster " CD-ROM 
 " 
 
 The vector data are in an optional DLG format. The raster data set consists of four images (one for each level of Hydrologic Unit classification) at a resolution of 1 kilometer.

        Quality
        
            Hydrologic unit boundaries were digitized from photo-reduced maps; digitized 
 line work was then compared to both the original source materials and U.S. 
 Geological Survey 1:2,000,000-scale digital line graph drainage maps to verify 
 the accuracy of the digitized lines. Attribute codes, which were assigned to 
 each hydrologic unit, were also verified.
