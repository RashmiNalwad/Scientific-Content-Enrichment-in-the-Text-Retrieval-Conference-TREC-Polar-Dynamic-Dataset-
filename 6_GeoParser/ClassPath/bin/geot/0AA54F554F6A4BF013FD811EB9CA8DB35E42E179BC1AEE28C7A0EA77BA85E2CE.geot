        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) LAS dataset is a survey of select areas within Southwest Florida. These data were produced for the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD). This metadata record describes the ortho & LIDAR mapping of Lake Hancock, in Polk County, FL. The mapping consists of LIDAR data collection, contour generation, and production of natural color orthophotography with a 1ft pixel using imagery collected with a Wild RC-30 Aerial Camera.     
                        

                    
                    
                        
                            

                            Purpose: 
                            The Southwest Florida Water Management District uses topographic information to support regulatory, land management and acquisition, planning, engineering, and habitat restoration projects. The purpose of this mapping project is to create and deliver digital terrain models (DTM), capable of generating one-foot contours and to produce orthophotography at a 200'.

            These data depict the elevations at the time of the survey and are only accurate for that time. Users should be aware that temporal changes may have occurred since this data set was collected and some parts of this data may no longer represent actual surface conditions. Users should not use this data for critical applications without a full awareness of its limitations.
