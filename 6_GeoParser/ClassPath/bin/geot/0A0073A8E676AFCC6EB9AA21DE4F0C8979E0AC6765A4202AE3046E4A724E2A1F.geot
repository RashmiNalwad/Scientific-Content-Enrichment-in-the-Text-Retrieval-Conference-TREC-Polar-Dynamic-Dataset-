        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            This data set consists of satellite measurements of global ocean color, 
 photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) and Land Reflectance (LND) data 
 obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), in orbit on 
 the OrbView-2 (formerly SeaStar) platform. SeaWiFS ocean color products are 
 processed and distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). 
 Processing details  ... can be found at 
 http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/DOCS/SW_proc.html 
 
 SeaWiFS acquires approximately 15 pole-to-pole orbital swaths of data per day, 
 and approximately 90% of the ocean surface is scanned every two days. Visible 
 and near infrared raw radiance counts are collected (Level 1A data) and are 
 converted to geophysical parameters (Level 2 data). Level 3 (9 km) data 
 processing involves both temporal and spatial binning and utilizes Level 2 
 Global Area Coverage (GAC) (4 km) data as input. 
 
 Each SeaWiFS Level-3 binned (9 km) data product consists of the accumulated 
 data for all Level-2 products, for the specified instrument and resolution, 
 corresponding to a period of one day, 8 days, a calendar month, a calendar 
 year, or the cumulative mission. Each Level-3 binned data product is stored in 
 one or more HDF files. The data are stored in a representation of a global, 
 equal-area grid whose grid cells, or "bins," have a resolution of 9.2x9.2km 
 (approximately 81 km2). 
 
 Each given time binning period (Daily, 8-Day, Monthly, Monthly Climatology, 
 Seasonal, Seasonal Climatology, Annual, Cumulative) has a separate file for 
 each product. These files include a main file containing all product-level 
 metadata, and data for each bin filled for that product and time period. In 
 addition, each product includes subordinate files, each of which contains data 
 of one binned geophysical parameter for all bins. Subordinate files must be 
 read in conjunction with the associated main file. The ocean color parameters 
 are the normalized water-leaving radiances (radiance data corrected for 
 atmospheric light scattering and sun angles differing from nadir), and 
 geophysical parameters derived from the radiance data. 
 
 SeaWiFS ocean color binned products consist of: 
 -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 412 nm [file x00 = nLw_412_sum] 
 -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 443 nm [file x01 = nLw_443_sum] 
 -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 490 nm [file x02 = nLw_490_sum] 
 -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 510 nm [file x03 = nLw_510_sum] 
 -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 555 nm [file x04 = nLw_555_sum] 
 -Normalized water-leaving radiance at 670 nm [file x05 = nLw_670_sum] 
 -Angstrom coefficient, 510-865 nm [file x06 = angstrom_510_sum] 
 -Chlorophyll-a concentration [file x07 = chlor_a_sum] 
 -Diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm [file x08 = K_490_sum] 
 -Epsilon of aerosol correction at 765 and 865 nm [file x09 = eps_78_sum] 
 -Aerosol optical thickness at 865 nm [file x10 = tau_865_sum] 
 
 Other SeaWiFS Level 3 Binned Products: 
 -SeaWiFS Level 3 PAR refers to false-colored images of Photosynthetically 
 Active Radiation (PAR) from the sun 400-700 nm. 
 For additional information about the PAR algorithm see 
 http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/DOCS/seawifs_par_wfigs.pdf 
 -SeaWiFS Land Reflectance (LND) refers to the images that depict land areas of 
 the world in quasi-natural-color

        Access Constraints
        
            From the start of instrument operations through January 1, 1998, all SeaWiFS 
 data is free and available to the public. Following January 1, 1998, SeaWiFS 
 data for scientific research will ONLY be available to Authorized Users who 
 have registered with the SeaWiFS Project. Any individual scientist who will be 
 conducting research that employs SeaWiFS data must be a registered Authorized 
 User. A single Authorized User cannot obtain data to be used anonymously by 
 members of a research group; all of the members of the group must be Authorized 
 Users. 
        
    



            
            
            







    
        Use Constraints
        
            Publications of research results utilizing these data must acknowledge the 
 SeaWiFS Project and the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) at the NASA 
 Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD, USA.
