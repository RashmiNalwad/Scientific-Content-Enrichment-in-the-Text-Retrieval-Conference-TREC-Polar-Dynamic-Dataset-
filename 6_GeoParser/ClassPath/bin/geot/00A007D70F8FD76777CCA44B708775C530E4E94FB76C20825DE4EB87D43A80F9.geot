    "A Celebration of Fifty
          Years of Satellite Laser Ranging"

    

 

      
    
    
    

     In Satellite Laser Ranging
        (SLR), a short laser pulse is transmitted from a ground station
        to an orbiting satellite and reflected back to the station,
        which measures the roundtrip time of flight and hence the
        station-to-satellite range. The first laser returns from an
        artificial satellite were recorded by a NASA team at Goddard
        Space Flight Center on 29 October 1964.The satellite, Beacon
        Explorer 22B, was equipped with a Laser Retroreflector Array
        (LRA), designed to return the laser light to its point of
        origin. In July 1969, the Apollo 11 astronauts placed the first
        LRA on the surface of the Moon; the number of lunar LRAs was
        later increased to 5 by Apollo 14 and 15 and two unmanned Soviet
        Lunakhod missions. Over the intervening decades, the ranging
        precision has improved from a few meters to a few mm and the
        number of stations in the global network has increased to about
        40. Today, the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS),
        formed in 1998, coordinates the tracking operations and data
        analysis activities of approximately 30 participating countries.
        SLR is one of four techniques currently in wide use by the space
        geodetic community; the others are Very Long Baseline
        Interferometry (VLBI), Global Navigation Satellite Systems (e.g.
        GPS) , and Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning by
        Satellite (DORIS). 

        

        SLR currently defines the Earth Scale Factor (GM) and the origin
        of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF), i.e.
        the Earth’s center of mass. Following the launch of the first
        geodetic satellites in the 1970s, SLR contributed heavily to our
        early modeling of the Earth’s gravity field, global tectonic
        plate motion, and regional crustal deformation near plate
        boundaries. Between VLBI sessions, SLR was also used to
        interpolate measurements of the Earth Orientation Parameters
        (EOP, which define the spin axis of the Earth and its
        time-dependent orientation and speed of rotation within the
        Celestial Reference Frame. More recently, SLR has been used to
        transfer time between atomic clocks, located on different
        continents, at the 50 picosecond level . 

        

        The Precise Orbit Determination (POD) capability of SLR has also
        supported a diverse array of Global Navigation Satellite Systems
        (GNSS), such as GPS, and international remote sensing
        satellites. For example, the combination of SLR with spaceborne
        microwave altimetry has provided spatially resolved maps of:
        global ocean currents and their velocities, mean sea level (MSL)
        rise, and even deep sea floor topography. With the advent of
        spaceborne laser altimeters, which derive much of their
        technology from the SLR program, high resolution topographic
        maps of the Earth, Moon, Mars, Mercury, and several asteroids
        have been obtained. In parallel, Lunar Laser Ranging has made
        important contributions to Lunar Physics, the Solar System
        Reference Frame, and General Relativity/Fundamental Physics. 

        

        Since the Millennium, a few SLR stations have developed the
        ability to track satellites in daylight using low energy kHz
        lasers and single photon returns. This demonstrated capability
        to extract very low level signals from the solar background has
        opened the door to precise interplanetary ranging and time
        transfer through the use of laser transponders, with the promise
        of further contributions to lunar and solar system science, more
        precise relativity experiments, and improved lunar and planetary
        mission operations. A second spinoff of single photon SLR
        technology has been the development of airborne and spaceborne
        single photon laser altimeters and 3D imaging lidars, which have
        demonstrated unprecedented surface measurement rates up to 3.2
        million pixels per second. 

        

        In October 2013, the Laser Communications Demonstration
        Experiment (LCDE) on NASA’s lunar LADEE mission demonstrated a
        622 Mbit/sec link between the Earth and Moon. Because they share
        a common need for precision optical tracking telescopes, the
        globally distributed SLR stations are potential hosts for future
        high bandwidth optical communications networks and may
        eventually perform both functions. Furthermore, the current SLR
        stations and satellite constellation can be used to simulate and
        test interplanetary transponder and optical communications links
        through the Earth’s atmosphere without the need for a new and
        costly space segment. 

        

        About the Speaker:

        

        Prior to joining Sigma Space Corporation as Chief Scientist in
        February 2003, Dr. Degnan accumulated over 38 years of
        technical, supervisory, and project management experience at
        NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center where he led the development
        of advanced lasers and electro-optical sensors. Supervisory
        positions at GSFC included: Head, Advanced Electro-optical
        Instrument Section (1979-1989), Deputy Manager, NASA Crustal
        Dynamics Project (1989-1993), and Head, Geoscience Technology
        Office (1993-2003). His GSFC organizations managed and/or
        provided direct technical, algorithm and software support to the
        NASA Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) and Very Long Baseline
        Interferometry (VLBI) space geodetic networks, the LAGEOS 2 and
        TOPEX/Poseidon missions, Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA),
        Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), and Messenger Laser
        Altimeter (MLA) missions to Mars, Earth, and Mercury
        respectively. He has authored over 200 publications (including
        many invited review papers and book chapters) on lasers and
        laser instrumentation. From 1989 to 1993, he held the post of
        Distinguished Adjunct Professor of Physics at The American
        University in Washington DC where he taught a two semester
        graduate course in Quantum Electronics. In 1998, he led the
        creation of the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) and
        served as its first Governing Board Chairperson until his
        retirement from NASA. Dr. Degnan is a Fellow of the
        International Association for Geodesy (IAG), a Senior Member of
        OSA and IEEE, a Charter Member of the International Laser
        Communications Society, and Sigma Pi Sigma National Physics
        Honor Society. He is the recipient of numerous awards from NASA
        (including GSFC’s prestigious Moe I. Schneebaum Memorial Award
        for Engineering in 1987), academia (including Drexel
        University’s Alumni Circle of Distinction Award in 2005), and
        international organizations (including the Tsiolkovsky Medal
        from the Director of the Russian Space Agency Rosaviacosmos in
        2002).
