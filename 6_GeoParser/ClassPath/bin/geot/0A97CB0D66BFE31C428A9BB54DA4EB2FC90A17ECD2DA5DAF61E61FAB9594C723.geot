                            Abstract: 
                            The Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) 
 Data Base at NCAR/HAO holds data collected from middle atmosphere 
 radars including MST radars, MF radars (partial reflection), LF 
 radars, meteor wind radars, and ST radars with Meteor Echo Detection 
 and Collection (MEDAC) systems. Data in the CEDAR Data Base consist 
 of the following: 
 
 MST Radars measure line-of-sight neutral  ... winds and turbulence. These 
 are: 
 1. MST data from Arecibo, Puerto Rico (18.35N, 66.75W). Data from 1989 
 are in the CEDAR Data Base. The radar has been in operation since 
 1979. The contact person is Qihou Zhou. The Arecibo Observatory is 
 operated by Cornell University under an agreement with the NSF. 
 
 2. MST data from Poker Flat, Alaska (65.13N, 147.46W). Data from 
 1979-1985 are in the CEDAR Data Base. The radar operated between 1979 
 and 1985 and form 1985-1987. The contact person is Anthony Riddle. The 
 Poker Flat MST radar was operated by NOAA Aeronomy Laboratory with 
 support from NSF. 
 
 MF Radars measure neutral winds and are averaged over several days and 
 analyzed in terms of harmonics. Derived parameters are the harmonic 
 analyses of the neutral winds. The following MF radar data sets are 
 available: 
 
 1. MF radar data from Scott Base, Antarctica (77.85S, 16675E). The 
 radar has been in operation since 1982. The contact person is Grahame 
 Fraser. The Scott Base MF radar is operated by the University of 
 Canterbury Physics Group with support from the New Zealand Grants 
 Committee and the New Zealand Antarctic Research Programme. 
 
 2. MF radar data from Mawson, Antarctica (67.62S, 62.89E). Data from 
 June 1984 to November 1990 are in the CEDAR Data Base. The radar has 
 been in operation since 1984. The contact person is Robert 
 Vincent. The Mawson MF radar is operated by the Atmospheric Physics 
 Group, University of Adelaide with support from the Australian 
 Research Council. 
 
 3. MF radar data from Christchurch, New Zealand (43.83S, 
 172.68E). Data in the CEDAR Data Base are from September 21-25, 
 1987. The radar has been in operation since 1962. The contact person 
 is Grahame Fraser. The Christchurch MF radar is operated by the 
 University of Canterbury Physics Group with support from the New 
 Zealand Grants Committee. 
 
 4. MF radar data from Adelaide, Australia (34.56S, 138.48E). Data from 
 Sep. 21-25, 1987; Dec 4-10, 1988; and, May 30-June 4, 1989 are in the 
 CEDAR Data Base. The radar has been in operation since 1983. The 
 contact person is Robert Vincent. The Adelaide MF radar is operated by 
 the Atmospheric Physics Group, University of Adelaide with support 
 from the Australian Research Council. 
 
 5. MF radar data from Saskatoon, Canada (52.21N, 107.11W). Data from 
 Sep. 21-25, 1987; Dec 4-10, 1988; May 30-June 4, 1989; and Feb 12-17, 
 1990 are in the CEDAR Data Base. The radar has been in operation since 
 1978. The contact person is Alan Manson. The Saskatoon MF radar is 
 operated by the University of Saskatchewan with support from the 
 Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada. 
 
 6. MF radar data from Tromso, Norway (69.60N, 19.2E). Data from

 available in the CEDAR Data Base. The radar has been in operation 
 since 1956. The contact person is Rudolph Schminder. The Collm LF 
 winprofiler is operated by the University of Leipzig. 
 
 Meteor Wind Radar data in the CEDAR Data Base are: 
 1. ST with MEDAC radar data from Chistmas Island (1,95N, 157.3W). Data

 November 1990 are in the CEDAR Data Base. The radar has been in 
 operation since 1988. The contact person is Susan Avery. The Christmas 
 island ST radar is operated by NOAA Aeronomy Laboratory. The MEDAC 
 system is operated by the University of Colorado with support from the 
 NSF.
