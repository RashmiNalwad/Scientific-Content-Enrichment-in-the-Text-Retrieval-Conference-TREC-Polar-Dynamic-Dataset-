How Much Ultraviolet (UV-B) Radiation Are We Getting?

Scientists determine UV-B exposure at the surface in two ways.  The
first way is by measuring it directly with instruments on the ground. 
These ground-based instruments can tell us the amount of UV-B radiation
reaching the surface at their exact locations.  Because the number of
these ground-based instruments is limited by cost and by the
inaccessibility of many locations around the globe, and because the
amount of UV-B radiation can vary enormously from one specific location
to another, we depend on data from satellites for long-term,
global-scale measurements of UV-B exposure.  Satellite data are greatly
contributing to scientists’ understanding of the effects of UV-B
radiation.



This map displays estimates of
UV-B irradiance at the surface based on the abundance of ozone, as
measured by NASA’s Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) instrument
during the month of November, 2000.  Data from satellites give us a
daily, global perspective on the distribution of UV-B irradiance on the
Earth’s surface. (Image by Reto Stöckli, based on data from 
the TOMS)


The second way to determine UV-B irradiance at the surface is by
making estimates based on satellite measurements of ozone, cloud cover,
and the other parameters described in What
Reaches Earth’s Surface.  Such estimates must take into account
changes in the amount of radiation coming from the sun to the top of the
atmosphere. To understand how researchers arrive at estimates of UV-B
radiation reaching the Earth’s surface, one must first visualize a
column of air that extends from the ground to the spacecraft above the
atmosphere.   Instruments on satellites orbiting the Earth (such as TOMS
and OMI/Aura) measure the amounts of ozone, cloud cover, and aerosols in
that column.  Researchers can accurately calculate how much UV-B
radiation there should be at the ground based on those measurements and
on other conditions described earlier in this article (elevation, angle
of sunlight, etc.).  These values for each satellite field of view are
incorporated into a global visualization of the data.


Satellite measurements are critical to our understanding of global
change such as increases in UV radiation.  Their importance derives from
their superior calibration over long periods, their ability to observe
remote or ocean-covered regions, and their capability of providing
consistent global coverage.  We also need well-maintained, strategically
located ground-based instruments to continue to verify the accuracy of
satellite-derived estimates of surface UV exposure over the globe.


Determining very long-term global trends still remains a problem
because we have little historical data available before 1978, when
NASA’s TOMS was first launched.  Our need for historical data to detect
and understand change underscores the critical importance of monitoring
the Earth’ws processes for a long period of time, an objective to which
NASA has committed in its Earth Observing System (EOS) program.


In September and October over Antarctica, loss of ozone and
consequent increased levels of UV-B radiation at the surface are now
commonly twice as high as during other times of the year.  High UV-B
exposures occur in nearby regions at both poles, including some regions
where people live, such as Scandinavia, most of Europe, Canada, New
Zealand, Australia, South Africa, and the southern region of South
America.  Exposures get especially high in regions of elevated altitude,
such as in the Andes Mountains, and in places that are relatively free
of clouds at certain times of the year, such as South Africa and
Australia during their summer (December to February).  In July, very
high exposures appear over the Sahara, Saudi Arabia, southwestern United
States, and the Himalayan Mountain regions in northern India and
southern China.  The equatorial regions have their maximum exposure in
the spring and autumn, with higher values during the autumn due to
decreased cloud cover.





The decrease of ozone
amounts in the upper atmosphere above Antarctica and nearby regions
between 1980 and 2000 has caused an increase in the amount of 
ultraviolet radiation striking the Earth and catalyzed extensive 
efforts by the scientific community to understand ozone chemistry.

Visualization Studio, based on data from TOMS)


We have no reliable long-term record of actual UV-B exposure from
ground-based measurements, but we do have accurate short-term estimates
of decreasing ozone, which we know leads to an increase in UV-B exposure
at the surface.  In Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion: 1998, the
World Meteorological Organization states that during 1998 at
mid-latitudes in the north, between 35 and 60 degrees N, average ozone
abundances were about 4 percent (per satellite measurements) or 5
percent (per ground-based measurements) below values measured in 1979,
with most of the change occurring at the high end of that latitude zone.
That means that recent UV-B radiation doses are correspondingly higher
at those latitudes than historical levels (by amounts that depend on
specific wavelengths).   In the tropics and mid-latitudes, between 35
degrees S and 35 degrees N, both satellite data and ground-based data
indicate that total ozone does not appear to have changed significantly
since 1979.
