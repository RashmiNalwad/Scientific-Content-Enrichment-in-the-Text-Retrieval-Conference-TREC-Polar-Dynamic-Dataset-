        Simplifying Installation of Avionics and Electronics with Box Rail Mount System
        Innovators at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center are seeking patent protection for a fastener system that is designed to simplify the placement, installation, and removal of avionics and electronics equipment within a variety of structures. This box rail mount system is lightweight, allows for self-alignment, minimizes the number of fasteners needed, does not require tools to operate, and can be handled by a single technician. The system consists of a “C” profile trail or track, a cartridge with a spring-loaded lockpin that slides in the track at spaced cut-outs, and a unique self-aligning cleat that allows the mounting of a flat or box-shaped component on a flat, curved, or irregular surface. This unique design is an improvement over prior designs that require two technicians to mount boxes on pallets and secure them with captive screws, using a tool specific to each fastening system. Developed for use in the aerospace industry, the system has broad applicability for fastener systems in the automotive, railway, and construction industries.


   
        Benefits

        	Streamlined: Features an ergonomic design that eases installation processes
	Efficient: Reduces manpower requirements by enabling a single technician to guide equipment into the rail and align and fasten the system
	Simplified: Reduces the need for additional tools by incorporating a fastening system into its design


        Commercial Applications

        	Aerospace platforms
	Commercial vehicle manufacturing, including automotive and railway systems
	Construction industry
	Mobile vehicle electronics and mobile labs
