                            Abstract: 
                            The National Guard Bureau - Counterdrug Office (NGB-CD), through its 
 Counterdrug Geographical Regional Assessment Sensor System (CD-GRASS) program, 
 has incorporated and collaboratively networked a Digital Mapping Server (DMS) 
 portal. The DMS portal ties disparate GIS databases together into a single 
 interface able to perform projection translation on the fly, and it allows 
 users to add datasets from their own systems. This program leverages both the 
 commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) ArcIMS software as well as the Geospatial 
 Information Database (GIDB) software created by the Naval Research Lab for the 
 Government (GOTS). The DMS portal is a joint effort of the Naval Research Lab 
 at Stennis Space Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, and the National 
 Guard Bureau Counterdrug Office.
