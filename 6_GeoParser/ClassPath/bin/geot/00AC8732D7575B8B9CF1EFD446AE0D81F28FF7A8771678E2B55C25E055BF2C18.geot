                            Abstract: 
                            This data set is no longer available because of errors in the data. See the http://nsidc.org/data/docs/daac/nsidc0094_avhrr_25km_abstract.gd.ht...>Error Sources section of the data set documentation for details. If you have further questions, please contact NSIDC User Services by e-mail at nsidc@nsidc.org or  ... telephone at +1 303.492.6199. The AVHRR Polar Pathfinder Twice-Daily 25 km EASE-Grid Composites are a collection of products for both poles, consisting of twice-daily gridded and calibrated satellite channel data and derived parameters. Data include five Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) channels, clear sky surface broadband albedo and skin temperature, average albedo and temperature, valid fraction file, solar zenith angle, satellite elevation angle, sun-satellite relative azimuth angle, surface type mask, cloud mask, cloud fraction files, and Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) of acquisition. The 25 km data are derived from the AVHRR Polar Pathfinder Twice-Daily 5 km EASE-Grid Composites, and extend poleward from 48.4 degrees north and 53.2 degrees south latitudes, spanning July 1981 through December 2000. Data are in 1-byte and 2-byte integer grid format and are available by FTP. Note: NSIDC reccommends the use of the Extended AVHRR Polar Pathfinder (APP-x) Product instead of our AVHRR Polar Pathfinder Twice-Daily 25 km EASE-Grid Composites. The APP-x 25 km product has albedo and temperature calculations for all sky conditions. Cloud properties are modeled to estimate the albedo and temperature under the clouds. An improved cloud detection algorithm is also used in the APP-x product.

        Quality
        
            Channel data are accurate to within approximately +/- 0.2 percent based on sensor noise level of 0.4 data number (DN). Temperatures are accurate to within approximately 2 degrees Kelvin. Relative albedos in adjacent grid cells are accurate to within approximately 5 percent. However, absolute albedo values are approximate. Accuracies for the products are difficult to determine, given the limited  ... nature of existing case studies. Also, conditions vary substantially across the large product domains and over time. Plans are being developed to further define product accuracies for snow-covered areas, sea ice, and ice sheets. Based on studies to date, accuracies in general are approximately +/- 2 degrees Kelvin for AVHRR-derived skin temperatures and +/- 0.05 degrees for surface albedo. Much of this error is likely due to uncertainties in the performance of the cloud detection methods. For clear sky conditions, accuracies for albedo and temperature products are expected to be in the range noted in the Barrow test, with temperatures accurate to +/- 0.5 degrees Celsius. Data and related information will be updated as appropriate. Additional comparisons with in-situ measurements of albedo and temperature are planned. See also Maslanik et al. (2000) for other accuracy discussions relative to SHEBA data.
