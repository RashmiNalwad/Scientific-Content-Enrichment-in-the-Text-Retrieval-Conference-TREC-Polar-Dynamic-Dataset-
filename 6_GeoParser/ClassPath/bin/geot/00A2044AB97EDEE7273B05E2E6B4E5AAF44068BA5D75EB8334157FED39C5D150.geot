                            Abstract: 
                            Annual sampling for the sixth Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research 
 (LTER) January cruise was completed in two legs. Zooplankton sampling 
 and bird observations within the foraging range of penguins near 
 Palmer Station (high density grid) was performed aboard the Research 
 Vessel Abel-J (LMGR98-8: 18Jan-24Jan) while the full LTER grid 
 (transect lines 600-200) and additional inshore station sampling were 
 performed aboard the Antarctic Supply and Research Vessel Laurence 
 M. Gould (LMG98-1: 28Jan-13Feb).
