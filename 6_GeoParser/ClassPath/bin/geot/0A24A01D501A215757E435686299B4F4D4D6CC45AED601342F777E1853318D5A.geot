        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The University of South Florida is implementing a real-time Coastal Ocean Monitoring and Prediction System (COMPS) for West Florida that will provide additional data needed to give more accurate predictions of ocean storms and coastal flooding by storm surge. 
 
 COMPS consists of an array of instrumentation both along the coast and offshore, combined with numerical circulation models, and builds  ... upon existing in-situ measurements and modeling programs funded by various state and federal agencies. This observing system fulfills all of the requirements of the Coastal Module of the Global Ocean Observing System (CMGOOS). Data and model products are disseminated in real-time to federal, state, and local emergency management officials via the internet (URL http://comps.marine.usf.edu/). COMPS is designed to enable researchers to more accurately predict ocean storms and coastal flooding caused by storm surges.
