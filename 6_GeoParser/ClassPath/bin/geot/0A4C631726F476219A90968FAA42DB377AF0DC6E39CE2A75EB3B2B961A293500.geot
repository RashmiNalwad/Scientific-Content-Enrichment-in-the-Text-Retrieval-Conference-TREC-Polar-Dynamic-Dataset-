						Postdoc Fellowships on Experimental Physics in Italy



 Are you a PhD interested in astroparticle physics or technology research? Do you love to travel? If so, we have a great opportunity for you! 

A research group at Italy’s National Nuclear Physics Institute  is looking for candidates willing to work at the INFN – Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati (INFN-LNF), in Frascati (Rome), Italy, at the SCF_LAB (Satellite/Lunar/GNSS laser ranging and altimetry Characterization Facilities’ LABoratory). 

They have two main research projects:

1) MoonLIGHT (Moon Laser Instrumentation for General relativity High accuracy Tests), on lunar laser ranging. This work is part of the INFN research field named “ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS” (see web announcement). It is carried out in collaboration with Prof. D. Currie at the University of Maryland and with the NLSI (and his successor).

2) ETRUSCO (Extra Terrestrial Ranging to Unified Satellite COnstellations), on satellite laser ranging to GNSS satellites (Galileo and GPS-3 in particular). This work is part of the INFN research field named “TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH” (see web announcement).

Candidates interested in the above two activities can contact simone.dellagnello@lnf.infn.it and follow instructions in the web announcement.

The deadline for applications is November 20, 2012. Apply at http://www.ac.infn.it/personale/exp_fellowships/
