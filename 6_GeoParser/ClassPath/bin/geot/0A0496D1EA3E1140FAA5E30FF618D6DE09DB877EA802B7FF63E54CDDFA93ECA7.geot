Description


    The QuickBird satellite is the first in a constellation of spacecraft that 
 DigitalGlobe is developing that offers highly accurate, commercial 
 high-resolution imagery of Earth. QuickBird's global  ... collection of panchromatic 
 and multispectral imagery is designed to support applications ranging from map 
 publishing to land and asset management to insurance risk assessment. 
 
 Today, DigitalGlobe's QuickBird is the only spacecraft able to offer sub-meter 
 resolution imagery, industry-leading geolocational accuracy, large on-board 
 data storage, and an imaging footprint 2 to 10 times larger than any other 
 commercial high-resolution satellite. 
 
 QuickBird was designed and built by our strategic partners, Ball Aerospace & 
 Technologies Corp., Kodak, and Fokker Space, all leaders in their fields. By 
 utilizing proven technology from each supplier, we have developed a 
 state-of-the-art, satellite system built from space-qualified components. This 
 system successfully meets DigitalGlobe's demanding performance requirements for 
 high image quality, robust image collection, and long mission life.
