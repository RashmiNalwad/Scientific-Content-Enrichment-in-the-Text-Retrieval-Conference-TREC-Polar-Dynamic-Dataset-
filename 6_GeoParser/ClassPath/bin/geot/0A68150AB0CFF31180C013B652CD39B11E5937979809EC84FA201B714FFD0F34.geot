                Definition:

                
                    Visualization / Image Processing services are defined as Data Analysis and Visualization Services that allow the user to view (Visualization) and/or manipulate (Image Processing) Earth Science data in a graphical (rather than numerical) format. These services may or may not include the ability for a user to view and/or manipulate data in a non-graphical (e.g., numerical) format, however, this ability would not be the primary method of operation of the service. EXAMPLES:
