                            Abstract: 
                            The world database of fungal names (IndexFungorum; aka funindex) 
 contains over 345,000 names of fungi (including yeast, lichens, 
 chromistan fungi, protozoan fungi and fossil forms) at species level 
 and below derived from a number of published list 
 have the full citation from the source publication (excluding those 
 from the last 5 years). Author citations conform with the Brummitt & 
 Powell standard (now searchable on line through IPNI), or are 
 indicated '{?}' thus. Many records include information on synonymy and 
 publication derived from numerous acknowledged sources. You may search 
 the database by either the species name or the specific epithet. 
 
 Information was taken from http://www.speciesfungorum.org.
