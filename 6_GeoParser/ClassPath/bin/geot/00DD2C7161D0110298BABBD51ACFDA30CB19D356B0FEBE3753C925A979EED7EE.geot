                            Abstract: 
                            This data product contains TOMS/Meteor-3 Total Column Ozone Daily L3 Global 1x1.25 deg Lat/Lon Grid Version 8 data in ASCII format. 
 
 (The shortname for this Meteor-3 TOMS Product is TOMSM3L3dtoz) 
 
 The Metero-3 Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) Version 8 Daily Gridded Data consist of daily, global coverage of total column ozone and UV-B Lambertian effective surface reflectivity (Rayleigh  ... corrected). 
 
 Four TOMS instruments have been successfully flown on the following satellites: Nimbus-7 (Nov. 1978 - May 1993), Meteor-3 (Aug. 1991 - Dec. 1994), Earth Probe (July 1996 - current), and ADEOS (Sep. 1996 - June 1997). 
 
 Earth Probe, Meteor-3 and Nimbus-7 data are currently reprocessed using the Version-8 algorithm (http://toms.gsfc.nasa.gov/version8/v8toms_atbd.pdf) . These Version-8 data are archived at the Goddard Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC). 
 
 The total ozone, aerosol index, reflectivity data and UV-B Erythemal irradiances are mapped to a global grid of size 180 x 288 with a Lat/Lon resolution of 1.00 x 1.25 degrees. These data are also stored in the EOS Version of Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS). HDF was developed by the National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
 
 TOMS data are produced by the Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (Code 613). The Version-8 Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) is available from the TOMS site http://toms.gsfc.nasa.gov/version8/v8toms_atbd.pdf

            Warning: Due to the extreme viewing conditions encountered when the orbit of Meteor-3 drifts near the terminator, only level 3 data taken when the sunlit portion of the orbit is between 9 AM and 3 PM for the first data year and between 8 AM and 4 PM for the remaining two data years will be archived in HDF format at the Goddard DAAC and available in CDROM format here (the stricter time constraint for the first data year is due to problems associated with the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo).
