        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The data sets in the CDC archive called "Reynolds SST' and 
 "Reconstructed Reynolds SST" were discontinued on 1 April 2003. 
 
 A new OI SST data set is available as described here, which includes a 
 new analysis for the historical data and updates into the future. NCEP 
 will not provide new data for the "Reynolds SST" after December 2002 
 and CDC will remove the "Reynolds SST" data set on 1 April 2003. 
 
  ... A new extended reconstructed SST data set is now available as 
 well. This data set replaces the "Reconstructed Reynolds SST", which 
 was removed from the CDC archive on 1 April 2003. 
 
 The optimum interpolation (OI) sea surface temperature (SST) analysis 
 is produced weekly on a one-degree grid. The analysis uses in situ and 
 satellite SST's plus SST's simulated by sea-ice cover. Before the 
 analysis is computed, the satellite data is adjusted for biases using 
 the method of Reynolds (1988) and Reynolds and Marsico (1993). A 
 description of the OI analysis can be found in Reynolds and Smith 
 (1994). 
 
 The bias correction improves the large scale accuracy of the 
 OI. Examples of the effect of recent corrections are given by Reynolds 
 (1993). The bias correction does add a small amount of noise in 
 time. Most of the noise can be eliminated by using a 1/4-1/2-1/4 
 binomial filter in time. CDC STRONGLY recommends that this filter be 
 applied to the data fields before they are used. An improved method of 
 correcting the biases is being developed. 
 
 
 Weekly Data 
 The optimum interpolation (OI) sea surface temperature (SST) analysis 
 is produced weekly on a one-degree grid. The analysis uses in situ and 
 satellite SST's plus SST's simulated by sea-ice cover. Before the 
 analysis is computed, the satellite data is adjusted for biases using 
 the method of Reynolds (1988) and Reynolds and Marsico (1993). 
 
 The OI.v2 analysis is described in Reynolds, R.W., N.A. Rayner, 
 T.M. Smith, D.C. Stokes, and W. Wang, 2002: An Improved In Situ and 
 Satellite SST Analysis for Climate, J. Climate. The paper has been 
 accepted by the Journal of Climate subject to minor revisions. A 
 preprint of the paper can from this anonymous ftp site: 
 ftp://ftpprd.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/cmb/sst/papers/oiv2pap/. 
 
 
 Monthly Data 
 The NOAA OI.v2 SST monthly fields are derived by a linear 
 interpolation of the weekly optimum interpolation (OI) version 2 
 fields to daily fields then averaging the daily values over a 
 month. The monthly fields are in the same format and spatial 
 resolution as the weekly fields. 
 
 Monthly Long-term Data 
 A climatology based on these fields was derived by Yan Xue of the NCEP 
 Climate Prediction Center following the technique of Reynolds and 
 Smith (1995) and Smith and Reynolds (1998). The climatology is 
 available here in the sst.ltm.*.nc files. 
 
 The OI data set consists of: 
 - Monthly means from 12/1981 to present 
 - Long term monthly mean, derived from data for 1961 - 1990 
 - Long term monthly mean, derived from data for 1971 - 2000 
 - Weekly means from 10/29/1981 to 12/28/1989 
 - Weekly means from 12/31/1989 to present 
 - The current weekly means are generally one week behind the current 
 date.
