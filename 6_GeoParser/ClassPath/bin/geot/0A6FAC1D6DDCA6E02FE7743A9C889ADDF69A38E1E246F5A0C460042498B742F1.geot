        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Biological invasions can have dramatic effects on freshwater ecosystems and introduced crayfish can be particularly impacting. We document crayfish distribution in three large hydrographic basins (Rogue, Umpqua, Willamette/Columbia) in the Pacific Northwest USA. We used occupancy analyses to investigate habitat relationships and evidence for displacement of native Pacifastacus leniusculus (Dana,  ... 1852) by two invaders. We found invasive Procambarus clarkii (Girard, 1852), in 51 of 283 sites and in all three hydrographic basins. We found invasive Orconectes n. neglectus (Faxon, 1885) at 68% of sites in the Rogue basin and provide first documentation of their broad distribution in the Umpqua basin. We found P. clarkii in both lentic and lotic habitats, and it was positively associated with manmade sites. P. leniusculus was positively associated with lotic habitats and negatively related to manmade sites. In the Rogue and Umpqua basins, O. n. neglectus and P. leniusculus were similar in their habitat associations. We did not find a negative relationship in site occupancy between O. n. neglectus and P. leniusculus. Our data suggest that P. clarkii has potential to locally displace P. leniusculus. There is still time for preventive measures to limit the spread of the invasive crayfish in this region 
    
                        

                    
                    
                        
                            

                            Purpose: 
                            The purpose of this study was to improve understanding of invasive crayfish in the PNW and supply information to agencies for integration into invasive species databases, management plans, and outreach efforts.

            Attribute_Accuracy_Report: 
 Field data were entered into a Microsoft Access 2010 database. All data entries were reviewed to ensure that the data were accurately entered. 
 
 Logical_Consistency_Report: 
 Data were checked for logical consistency by writing grouping queries to examine the proper spelling and standardization of all  ... text fields. Range queries were written to confirm that numerical values were not outside a reasonable range for a particular field. Bounding dates were confirmed as correct. Raw/original data sheets were reviewed to confirm that the data had been entered correctly. 
 
 Completeness_Report: 
 The data gathered from any trap with a hole in the outside mesh, broken tunnel, tipped up on end or otherwise disturbed between the time of trap set to trap pull such that it no longer performed its intended function (i.e., under the surface of the water, in roughly the same location as it was set, at least one side resting on and parallel to the substrate, both funnel openings not obstructed, etc.), were excluded from the analysis.
