                            Abstract: 
                            To better understand physical structure of snow stratification, a 1m deep pit was dug at every camp site. The following items were investigated: (i) density with 3 cm resolution, (ii) dielectric permittivity measured using a “Snow Fork” and Denoth method, snow grain size measurement, snow type observation and visual observation of the stratigraphy. H. Enomoto and S. Sugiyama led pit works. The pit work was done along a route connecting “Syowa – Mizuho – Dome Fuji – JASE Meeting Point (75°53’S; 25°50’E; 3661 m a.s.l.) – Kohnen – Wasa”.
