                Definition:

                
                    "Glacial landforms" are landforms derived from the erosion and deposition
caused by glaciers and ice sheets, associated meltwater, and the Earth's
rheological response.  Such landforms include drumlins, moraines, cirques,
fjords, etc.  "Glacial processes" include deposition of sediments and erosion
of the Earth's surface by grinding, scouring, and polishing effected by the
movement of glacier ice armed with rock fragments frozen into it, together with
the erosive action of meltwater streams.
