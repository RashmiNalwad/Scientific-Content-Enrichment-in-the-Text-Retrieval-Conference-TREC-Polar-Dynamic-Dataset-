                            Abstract: 
                            This product has been decommissioned. 
 
 These four daily MODIS fire observations will advance global fire monitoring with 1 km resolution fire channels centered at the 4 and 11 micrometer wavelengths. MODIS data will also be used to monitor burn scars, vegetation type and condition, smoke aerosols, water vapor and clouds for overall monitoring of the fire process and its effects on ecosystems, the  ... atmosphere, and climate. A data base of active fire products will be generated and archived at 1 km resolution and summarized on a grid of 10 km and .5o latitude/longitude at daily, 8-day, and monthly intervals. It includes the fire occurrence and location, the rate of emission of thermal energy from the fire and a rough estimate of the smoldering/flaming ratio. This information will be used in monitoring the spatial and temporal distribution of fires in different ecosystems, detecting changes in fire distribution and identifying new fire frontiers, wild fires, and changes in the frequency of the fires or their relative strength.
