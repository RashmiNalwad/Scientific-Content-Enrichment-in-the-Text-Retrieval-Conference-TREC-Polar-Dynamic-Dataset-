                            Abstract: 
                            Oceanographic measurements were conducted along WOCE Southern Ocean meridional section SR3 between Tasmania and Antarctica, and around the boundary of a square-plan test volume south of the Antarctic Divergence, from July to September 1995 on voyage 1 of the 1995/1996 summer season. A total of 208 CTD vertical profile stations were taken, 64 of those to near bottom, and the remaining 144 to a  ... depth of 500 m. Over 2300 Niskin bottle water samples were collected for the measurement of salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients (phosphate, nitrate+nitrite, silicate), dissolved organic and inorganic carbon, iodate/iodide, primary productivity, and biological parameters, using both a 24 and 12 bottle rosette sampler. Near surface current data were collected using a ship mounted ADCP. Measurement and data processing techniques are summarised, and a summary of the data are presented in graphical and tabular form.
