        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Deep ground radar sounding was carried out at the onset of Ice Stream D 
 (Bindschadler Ice Stream), Siple Coast, West Antarctica using the UT/TUD 60 MHz 
 radar system, configured for pulsed transmission and coherent acquisition and 
 intergration. Signal to noise was not optimal due to antenna configuration 
 issues. The radar survey lines at the Ice Stream D were based on a  ... nominal 2.5 
 km grid covering a block 70 x 30 km with OND field camp located in center. The 
 total length of deep ground radar survey lines is about 1200 km. All equipment 
 was mounted inside the Wanagan in the 19" equipment racks. The Wanagan was 
 pulled by Tractor Jucker Sno-Cat. The equipment's power supply was obtained 
 from 24 V 100 AH Batteries, charged from Tractor. TRIMFLIGHT was used for 
 navigation. The external monitor for the driver was mounted in the tractor 
 cabin.

                                Description: 
                                The Siple Coast ice streams exhibit rapid ice flow under low driving stress.
 The physical processes that control ice streaming prescribes the ice stream
 system's ability to evolve and contribute to, or respond to ice sheet
 evolution. The location where streaming begins, the onset, is the optimal place
 to identify these controlling factors.
