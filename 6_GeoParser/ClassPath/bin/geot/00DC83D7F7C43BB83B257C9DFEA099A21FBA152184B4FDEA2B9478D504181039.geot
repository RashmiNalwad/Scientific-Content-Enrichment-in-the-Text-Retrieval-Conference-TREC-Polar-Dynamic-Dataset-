    Summary


    

    
    	

    
        
            Abstract: 
            Taken from the survey report:

Documentation is provided for surveying tasks - by Tom Velthuis - at Macquarie Island and Casey, during the summer of 2000/1.  The report is presented in five key sections:
1. GPR related surveying in Thala Valley - Casey;
2. Non GPR related surveying in Thala Valley;
3. Surveys conducted outside of Thala Valley;
4. Surveys at Macquarie Island; and
5. Survey data to GIS.
The first three sections relate to Casey; the fourth section to Macquarie Island; and the fifth section documents the transfer of data to GIS.

For more details see the report available as part of the download.

Taken from the readme file accompanying the data:

The folder named, 'shape' contains projected (UTM) and unprojected shapefiles, based on WGS84, relating to surveys by Tom Velthuis at Macquarie Island and Casey during the summer 2000/2001 season.  See report: Survey Report.doc.

The folder named, 'excel_files' contains excel files by Tom Velthuis used for computing surveying work performed at Macquarie Island and Casey during the summer 2000/1.  The 'Windmill Islands control' file is a file given to Tom by Tom Gordon.

The folder labelled, 'tomv pics scanned' contains photographs (by Tom Velthuis) relating to surveying work conducted at Casey during the summer 2000/1.  Most of the photos are in the report labelled, 'Survey Report.doc'.

The folder labelled, 'TomVforGIS' contains files generated by Tom Velthuis, for the creation of shapefiles in ArcView.
The files relate to Surveying work conducted at Macquarie Island and Casey during Summer 2000/1.

macca_levels.xls has additional notes on the levelling of buildings at Macquarie Island.


Also, map number 13248 in the SCAR Map Catalogue shows crosses on the buildings at Macquarie Island indicating the approximate location of levelling to the buildings. 
macca_levels.xls has the same content as the dbf file referred to on the map.
