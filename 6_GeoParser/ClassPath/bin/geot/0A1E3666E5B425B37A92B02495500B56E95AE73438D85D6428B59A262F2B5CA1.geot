                            Daily Tmin, Tmax, Precip data for 1881-1985, interpolated to fill missing intervals. Prepared by the Oklahoma Climatological Survey under the direction of Amos Eddy. Long term averages of daily values are also available as they are prerequisite to the interpolation scheme.
