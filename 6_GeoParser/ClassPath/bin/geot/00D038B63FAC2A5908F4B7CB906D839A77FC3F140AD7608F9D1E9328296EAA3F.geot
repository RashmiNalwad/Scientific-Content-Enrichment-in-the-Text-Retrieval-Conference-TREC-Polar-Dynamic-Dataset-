        NASA's Earth & Space Science Education Product Review
    


      NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) sponsors independent peer reviews of its Earth and space science education materials for formal (K-12 and higher education) and informal education. Panels of both scientists and educators (e.g., classroom teachers, college faculty, NASA teacher trainers, curriculum developers, and national education standards experts) review the education products. The purpose of these peer reviews is to ensure education products distributed by NASA are of high quality and meet rigorous standards, and to provide feedback to product developers.
    

      For more information, including schedule, guidelines, review criteria, go to: http://nasareviews.strategies.org/. Product developers also register on this site and submit products online to the review.  This review is limited to products sponsored by or largely based on NASA SMD content.
