Description: Amendment 51 delays the due date for proposals to ROSES-2014 A.29 Climate Indicators and Data Products for Future National Climate Assessments (INCA) to February 6, 2015, to allow more time for those without power following the recent blizzard in the northeast.

            

	A.29 Climate Indicators and Data Products for Future National Climate Assessments (INCA) solicits research in support of the future the U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA). This solicitation seeks to motivate research responding to the vision of the sustained assessment by increasing the knowledge base and capacity needed to enable the effective integration of new scientific understanding into management decisions. This can be achieved by enhancing the production of decision-support tools, initiating continuous improvements in collecting and synthesizing information, and by providing feedback to ongoing research efforts. NASA aims to better integrate the climate indicator work with assessment product generation and assessment tools projects at NASA Centers. Contributions are sought to enhance NASA’s participation in future NCAs by encouraging the developing and testing of potential indicators that best address the needs expressed in the NCA indicator vision (see, for example, http://www.globalchange.gov/what-we-do/assessment/indicators) and that leverage NASA’s capabilities.

	 

	Proposals to ROSES-2014 A.29 are now due February 6, 2015. They due date was delayed to allow more time for those without power following the recent blizzard in the northeast.
