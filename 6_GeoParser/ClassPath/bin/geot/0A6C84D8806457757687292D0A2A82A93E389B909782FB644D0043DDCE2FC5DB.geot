        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            This data set includes argon 40/36 and nitrogen 15/14 measurements across three 
 glacial terminations from the Vostok Ice Core, Antarctica. These data are 
 thought to provide an indirect proxy for the timing of temperature change, 
 although the exact mechanism is not yet clear. They are useful for comparison 
 with carbon dioxide concentration data, because they directly give  ... the relative 
 timing of carbon dioxide and temperature changes. Because argon is a gas, like 
 CO2, there is no uncertainty arising from the gas age-ice age difference. The 
 argon data from Termination III are published in: 
 
 Caillon, N., Severinghaus, J.P., Jouzel, J., Barnola, J.-M., Kang, J., and 
 Lipenkov, V.Y. Timing of atmospheric CO2 and Antarctic temperature changes 
 across Termination III, Science 299, 1728-1731 (2003). 
 
 The nitrogen isotopes, and argon isotopes from Terminations II and IV have not 
 yet been published. Jeff Severinghaus is the contact person. This work was 
 supported by NSF-OPP 01-25468.
