          Status Report # 06

          Saturday, Dec. 8, 2001 – 7 a.m. CST

        The crews aboard 
          Endeavour and International Space Station awoke this morning to begin 
          their first full day of joint operations following yesterday’s 
          docking between the two vehicles. 

        Pilot Mark Kelly 
          and Mission Specialist Linda Godwin will work together to remove the 
          Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module from Endeavour’s payload 
          bay and attach it to the Unity node of the International Space Station. 
          Over the course of about three hours, Kelly will use the shuttle’s 
          robotic arm to gently lift Raffaello from the payload bay and maneuver 
          it into place, securing it to the Earth-facing berthing port on the 
          Unity module about 12:39 p.m. CST today. 

        As Kelly works 
          to install the Raffaello module, the formal exchange of space station 
          crews will occur as the Expedition Three crew – Commander Frank 
          Culbertson, Pilot Vladimir Dezhurov, and Flight Engineer Mikhail Tyurin 
          – and the Expedition Four crew – Commander Yury Onufrienko, 
          and Flight Engineers Carl Walz and Dan Bursch, exchange their customized 
          seat liners in the Russian Soyuz spacecraft. As each Expedition Four 
          crew member’s seatliner is installed in the Soyuz and checked out, 
          he officially becomes a resident of the space station with the Expedition 
          Three crew member moving over to become a member of the Endeavour crew. 
          Handover briefings between the crews will continue throughout docked 
          operations. 

        Mission Specialist 
          Dan Tani will focus his attention on transferring equipment from Endeavour 
          to the space station while Commander Dom Gorie tends to vehicle operations. 
          

        The three commanders 
          onboard – Gorie, Culbertson and Onufrienko – along with Endeavour’s 
          Pilot Kelly will participate in media interviews at 3:44 p.m. CST. MSNBC, 
          CBS News and WAGT-TV in Augusta, Georgia will have the opportunity to 
          interview the crewmembers in the station’s Destiny laboratory. 
          

        Two payload bay 
          experiments located in the Multiple Application Customized Hitchhiker-1 
          (MACH-1) facility have already completed 50% and 76% of their mission 
          objectives. Those experiments are the Capillary Pumped Loop Experiment 
          (CAPL) and the Prototype Synchrotron Radiation Detector (PSRD) respectively. 
          The CAPL demonstrates a multiple evaporator capillary pumped loop system 
          and the PSRD measures cosmic ray background data. 

        The next STS-108 
          mission status report will be issued at about 6 p.m. CST today or as 
          events warrant.
