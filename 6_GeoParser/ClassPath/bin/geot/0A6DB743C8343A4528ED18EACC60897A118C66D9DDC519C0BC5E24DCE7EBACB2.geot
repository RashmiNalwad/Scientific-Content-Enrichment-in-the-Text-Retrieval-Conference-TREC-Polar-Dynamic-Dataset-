                            Abstract: 
                            The Science Coordination Office (SCO) for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide Ice Core is managed by the Desert Research Institute (DRI), Nevada System of Higher Education and by the Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space at the University of New Hampshire (UNH). The U.S research community is conducting a deep ice coring project in West Antarctica for studies of climate, ice sheet  ... history and cryobiology. This project is collecting a deep ice core from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) ice flow divide and integrating approximately 20 separate but synergistic projects to analyze the ice and interpret the records 
 
 
 The principal investigators of the SCO are Dr. Kendrick Taylor (DRI), Chief Scientist and head of the SCO, and Mr. Mark Twickler (UNH), SCO Manager.

NICL-SMO serves as the primary point of contact for scientists interested in access to ice cores stored at NICL and/or use of the NICL facility. NICL-SMO also facilitates the Ice Core Working Group (ICWG). NICL-SMO, with the assistance of the ICWG, oversees the scientific operations and activities at NICL.

        Use Constraints
        
            Once a request has been approved by the Committee and NSF, the Scientific 
 Coordinator will notify the requesting investigator. The investigator should 
 then contact the Facility Curator to arrange for a visit to NICL to work on 
 samples or to arrange for transport of samples to their home institution. The 
 Facility may charge investigators to recover labor, freight or mailing  ... expenses 
 involved in filling requests. The Curator will furnish a charge estimate, if 
 required, before processing the request. 
 
 Data derived from measurement and analysis of all samples from the Facility 
 must be archived at an appropriate Data Center, as described in the NSF-OPP 
 data policy NSF-OPP data policy. 
 
 Subsequent sample requests for the same investigation must include a statement 
 that describes progress of the study, the need for additional samples, and the 
 status of previous samples. Approval of an initial request does not constitute 
 approval for subsequent access to the core collection. New requests by the same 
 applicant or group will be honored when results from previous requests have 
 been published as research papers in scientific journals, as research reports 
 or data is archived at an established data center. Any conflicts between the 
 Facility, NICL-SMO and an investigator will be referred to the Office of Polar 
 Programs. 
 
 If any work is to be done on samples that is in addition to, or different than, 
 that stated on the original request, the Scientific Coordinator must first be 
 notified.. In order to prevent duplicative efforts, recipients of samples must 
 not allow research projects that differ substantially from projects originally 
 proposed in sample requests to be undertaken by themselves or others without 
 first obtaining permission and approval from the Scientific Coordinator. 
 Samples must not be transferred to other investigators without prior 
 notification Any unused samples or portions of cores must be returned to the 
 Facility for re-archiving and possible allocation to another investigator. The 
 objective of this provision is not to restrict research; on the contrary, the 
 objective is to insure that the best possible use is made of the samples and 
 that the Scientific Coordinator is fully informed as to their use and 
 disposition. 
 
 Investigators who simply wish to make a brief examination of specific cores 
 (without sampling or conducting analyses) may apply informally to the 
 Scientific Coordinator. A decision will be made quickly to facilitate this 
 activity. 
 
 Once a request has been approved by the SAC and NSF, the Scientific Coordinator 
 will notify the requesting investigator. The investigator should then contact 
 the NICL Curator to arrange for a visit to NICL to work on samples or to 
 arrange for transport of samples to their home institution. NICL may charge 
 investigators to recover freight or mailing expenses involved in filling 
 requests. The Curator will furnish a charge estimate, if required, before 
 processing the request. 
 
 
 INVESTIGATOR RESPONSIBILITIES 
 
 1. Prompt publication of significant results, with acknowledgment of the 
 National Science Foundation as the source of materials. 
 2. Submittal of information to the Scientific Coordinator pertaining to 
 samples obtained from the Facility. In addition, be sure to include this 
 information in your annual NSF report. 
 3. Notification to the Scientific Coordinator of any significant change in 
 the research plan described in the original request. 
 4. Data derived from material from the Facility must be archived at an 
 established data center in accordance to the NSF-OPP data policy.
