                Definition:

                
                    Suspension of particles of condensed matter (liquid, solid, or mixed) in
a carrier gas (usually air).  Aerosols are important in the atmosphere as
nuclei for the condensation of water droplets and ice crystals, as
participants in various chemical cycles, and as absorbers and scatterers
of solar radiation, thereby influencing the radiation budget of the
earth-atmosphere system, which in turn influences the climate on the
surface of the Earth.
