                            Abstract: 
                            The CD-ROM contains the 250m resolution RADARSAT-1 SAR Mosaic of Antarctica and the Image Explorer software for viewing the data. The mosaics are a part of the RADARSAT-1 Antarctic Mapping Project, a collaboration between CSA and NASA. Partners include the Byrd Polar Research Center of the Ohio State University, the Alaska Satellite Facility, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and Vexcel Corporation.
