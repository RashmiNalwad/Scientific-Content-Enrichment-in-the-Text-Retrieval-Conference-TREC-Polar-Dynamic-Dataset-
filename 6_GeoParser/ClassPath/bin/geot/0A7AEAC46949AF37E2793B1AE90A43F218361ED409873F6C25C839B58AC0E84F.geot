                Definition:

                
                    Boreholes are holes drilled deep into the ground (or ocean crust). Profiles of
rock temperatures with depth can be related to the history of temperature
changes at the surface, which can be converted to estimates of air temperature.
Borehhole temperature measurements can provide estimates of local temperature
variations over time intervals of a few hundred to over a thousand years.
