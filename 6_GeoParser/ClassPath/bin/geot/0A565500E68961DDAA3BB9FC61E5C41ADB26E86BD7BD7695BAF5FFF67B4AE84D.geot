    Summary

    
    

    
    	

    
        
            Abstract: 
            The Environmental Mercury Mapping, Modeling, and Analysis (EMMMA) Tool supports
mercury research and decision-making by providing tools for Mapping, Modeling,
and Analysis of mercury data.

The Environmental Mercury Mapping, Modeling, and Analysis (EMMMA) website, a
joint effort of USGS and NIEHS, is designed to support environmental and health
researchers, as well as land and resource managers by providing the following
tools:

-Online mapping tools, USGS maps, images and other thematic data from The
National Map to display and analyze mercury data and to print maps. The
National Map provides nationwide geographic reference composed of aerial
photographs, Landsat satellite images, and geospatial data for land cover,
elevation, hydrology, transportation, and geographic names.

-An online descriptive model for Hg mercury in fish-tissue, which standardizes
the concentrations of mercury in fish to enable comparisons among different
species, individuals of different lengths and samples of different types. The
model is applied to a comprehensive national compilation of fish-tissue data to
detect spatial and temporal trends in mercury concentrations that would
otherwise be obscured.

-Easy access to key environmental mercury data sets, including atmospheric
mercury emissions, National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) monitoring
sites,  and mercury concentrations in fish-tissue, soils, stream sediments, and
coal. All data are downloadable in shapefile format with included .dbf files
