        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The Japanese Earth Resources Satellite was launched in February 1992. It 
 carries a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument (L-band) and a 7 band 
 optical sensor package covering the near infrared and shortwave infrared 
 region of the spectrum. Both sensors have a ground resolution of 18 m. 
 The satellite has a repeat cycle of 44 days. 
 
 Eurimage distributes data acquired from ESA stations at Fucino, Tromso and 
 O'Higgins from 1993, thus providing coverage of Europe and Antarctica.
