        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Oceanographic measurements were conducted in the vicinity of the Amery Ice Shelf on two cruises, during the southern summers of 2000/2001 and 2001/2002. A CTD transect parallel to the front of the Amery Ice Shelf was occupied on both cruises, including repeat occupations on each cruise. A total of 100 CTD vertical profile stations were taken near the ice shelf, most to within 20 m of the bottom,  ... and over 1150 Niskin bottle water samples were collected for the measurement of salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, helium, tritium, oxygen 18 and biological parameters, using a 12 bottle rosette sampler mounted on either a 24 or 12 bottle frame. On the first cruise, an additional 39 CTD stations were occupied around an experimental krill survey area in the vicinity of Mawson. Additional CTD stations were taken at the end of each cruise for calibration of CTD instrumentation from borehole sites on the Amery Ice Shelf. Near surface current data were collected on both cruises using a ship mounted ADCP. An array of 9 moorings comprising current meters, thermosalinographs and upward looking sonars were deployed along the ice shelf front in February 2001 during the first cruise, and retrieved on the second cruise in February 2002. A summary of all data and data quality is presented in the data report.
