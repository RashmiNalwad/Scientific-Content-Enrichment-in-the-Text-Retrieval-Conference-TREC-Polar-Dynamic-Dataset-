	            MY NASA DATA Webinar for Educators: Analyzing Solar Energy Graphs  (March 26, 6:30pm EST)
	                
	                    
	                    

This 90-minute webinar allows educators to become familiar with the MY NASA DATA activity “Solar Cell Energy Availability From Around the Country.” Compare monthly averages of downward radiation in locations around the U.S. and analyze where conditions would be conductive to having solar panels. Access data on the NASA Live Access Server as participants “journey” around the U.S. to determine the amount of solar radiation and analyze overly plots to compare data from NASA satellites.
