                            Abstract: 
                            This dataset contains the locations of sampling sites for ASAC project 40 on rotation 0 of the French polar supply ship L'Astrolabe in the 2002/2003 season. Samples were collected between October and November of 2002. It also contains the final dataset which has information on chlorophyll, carotenoids, coccolithophorids and species indentification and counts. 
 
 Public Summary from the project: 
 
  ... This program aims to determine the role of single celled plants, animals, bacteria and viruses in Antarctic waters. We quantify their vital role as food for other organisms, their potential influence in moderating global climate change through absorption of CO2 and production of DMS, and determine their response to effect of climate change.
