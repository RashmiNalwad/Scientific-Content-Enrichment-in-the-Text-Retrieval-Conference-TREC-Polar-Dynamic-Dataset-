 ---- Public Summary from Project---- 
 Mosses are dominant plants in the vegetation of continental Antarctica. This projects measurements of moss growth rates in several habitats will allow estimates of the ages of stands of moss, predictions of the rate of recovery from disturbance, and  ... predictions of moss growth rates under changed climatic conditions. 
 
 From the abstract of the referenced paper: 
 
 Using steel pins inserted into growing moss colonies near Casey Station, Wilkes Land, continental Antarctica, we have measured the growth rate of three moss species: Bryum pseudotriquetrum and Schistidium antarctici over 20 years and Ceratodon purpureus over 10 years. This has provided the first long term growth measurements for plants in Antarctica, confirming that moss shoots grow extremely slowly in Antarctica, elongating between 1 and 5 mm per year. Moss growth rates are dependent on availability of water. Antheridia were observed on some stems of B. pseudotriquetrum; no archegonia or sporophytes were observed. Stems bearing antheridia elongated much more slowly than vegetative stems in the same habitat. Two other methods of growth rate measurement were tested, and gave similar rates of elongation over shorter periods of time. However, for long-term measurements, the steel pin measurements proved remarkably reproducible and reliable.

 From the referenced paper: 
 
 Measurement sites were established in 1982, in an area of abundant moss growth near Casey Station on the shore of Vincennes Bay, Wilkes Land, Antarctica. The study sites are within the area that has since been designated ASPA 135 (SCAR 2004). The study area was roughly  ... level, with higher ground to the south from which a small drainage line carried melt water. Beyond a low ridge to the east was a small lake with a rocky margin. The area was scattered with rocks, and three species of moss, Bryum pseudotriquetrum, Ceratodon purpureus, and Schistidium antarctici, formed continuous turfs amongst the rocks in parts of the study area. Plants growing on the higher ground to the south and east formed discontinuous cover, often bolsters, in drier habitats than those along the drainage line or at the lake margin. The level of available moisture at a site influenced the occurrence of species at the site, and morphology of the mosses. Morphology of B. pseudotriquetrum and S. antarctici was strikingly different at wet and dry sites. 
 
 Method 1: measurements against cranked wires (or pins). 
 Method 2: measurements of stems cut from a turf, bagged or tied into bundles, replaced and remeasured. 
 Method 3: measurement of growth above a stain applied to stems.
