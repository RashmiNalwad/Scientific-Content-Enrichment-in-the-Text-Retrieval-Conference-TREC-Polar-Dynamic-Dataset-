        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The PSU/NCAR mesoscale model is a limited-area, nonhydrostatic or hydrostatic 
 (Version 2 only), terrain-following sigma-coordinate model designed to simulate 
 or predict mesoscale and regional-scale atmospheric circulation. It has been 
 developed at Penn State and NCAR as a community mesoscale model and is 
 continuously being improved by contributions from users at several  ... universities 
 and government laboratories. 
 
 The Fifth-Generation NCAR / Penn State Mesoscale Model (MM5) is the latest in a 
 series that developed from a mesoscale model used by Anthes at Penn State in 
 the early 70's that was later documented by Anthes and Warner (1978). Since 
 that time, it has undergone many changes designed to broaden its usage. These 
 include (i) a multiple-nest capability, (ii) nonhydrostatic dynamics, which 
 allows the model to be used at a few-kilometer scale, (iii) multitasking 
 capability on shared- and distributed-memory machines, (iv) a four-dimensional 
 data-assimilation capability, and (v) more physics options. 
 
 The model (known as MM5) is supported by several auxiliary programs, which are 
 referred to collectively as the MM5 modeling system. 
 
 A schematic diagram (a pdf file, to be opened by Adobe Acrobat Reader) is 
 provided to facilitate discussion of the complete modeling system. It is 
 intended to show the order of the programs and the flow of the data, and to 
 briefly describe their primary functions. Documentation for various programs in 
 the modeling system is available online. 
 
 Terrestrial and isobaric meteorological data are horizontally interpolated 
 (programs TERRAIN and REGRID) from a latitude-longitude mesh to a variable 
 high-resolution domain on either a Mercator, Lambert conformal, or polar 
 stereographic projection. Since the interpolation does not provide mesoscale 
 detail, the interpolated data may be enhanced (program RAWINS or little_r) with 
 observations from the standard network of surface and rawinsonde stations using 
 either a successive-scan Cressman technique or multiquadric scheme. Program 
 INTERPF performs the vertical interpolation from pressure levels to the sigma 
 coordinate system of MM5. Sigma surfaces near the ground closely follow the 
 terrain, and the higher-level sigma surfaces tend to approximate isobaric 
 surfaces. Since the vertical and horizontal resolution and domain size are 
 variable, the modeling package programs employ parameterized dimensions 
 requiring a variable amount of core memory. Some peripheral storage devices are 
 also used. 
 
 Since MM5 is a regional model, it requires an initial condition as well as 
 lateral boundary condition to run. To produce lateral boundary condition for a 
 model run, one needs gridded data to cover the entire time period that the 
 model is integrated. 
 
 MM5 has been used for a broad spectrum of theoretical and real-time studies, 
 including applications of both predictive simulation and four-dimensional data 
 assimilation to monsoons, hurricanes, and cyclones. On the smaller meso-beta 
 and meso-gamma scales (2-200 km), MM5 has been used for studies involving 
 mesoscale convective systems, fronts, land-sea breezes, mountain-valley 
 circulations, and urban heat islands. The model allows for multiple levels of 
 nesting for cases involving scale interaction. Since the model is designed 
 primarily for research applications, modification and development will 
 continue.
