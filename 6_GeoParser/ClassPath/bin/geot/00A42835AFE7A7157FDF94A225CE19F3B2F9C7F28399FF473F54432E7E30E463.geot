                            Abstract: 
                            The March 12-15, 1993 superstorm will be remembered as one of the 
 strongest storms to ever strike the Eastern United States. Overall, 
 270 fatalities were reported with an estimate property damage over $3 
 billion. Record sea level pressure, low temperatures, and wind gusts 
 were reported by many observation stations. The entire East Coast of 
  ... the United States from Florida to Maine was affected by this storm. 
 
 The University of Illinois Weather World 2010 project offers an 
 extensive case study of this major weather event. This study begins 
 with an introduction and is followed by archived surface products and 
 satellite imagery. The surface products (surface analysis) begin at 
 1200 UTC on March 12, 1993 and end 0900 UTC March 15, 1993. The 
 satellite imagery (visible, infrared, water vapor) begins at 0000 UTC 
 March 12, 1993 and ends 2300 UTC March 15, 1993. 
 
 This case study is available via World Wide Web from The Weather World 
 2010 Home Page.
