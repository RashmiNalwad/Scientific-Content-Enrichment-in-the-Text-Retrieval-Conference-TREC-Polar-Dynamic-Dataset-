Description: 

This Web Coverage Service (WCS) is one of the multiple GES DISC data service instances used to provide gridded Level 3 daily OMI data products. Accessing to this URL will result in a brief description of coverages (i.e., data layers or variables), or a getCapabilities response. A client can request more detailed information about the served coverages by sending a describeCoverage request to the server. Finally, a client can request actual data using a getCoverage request.
