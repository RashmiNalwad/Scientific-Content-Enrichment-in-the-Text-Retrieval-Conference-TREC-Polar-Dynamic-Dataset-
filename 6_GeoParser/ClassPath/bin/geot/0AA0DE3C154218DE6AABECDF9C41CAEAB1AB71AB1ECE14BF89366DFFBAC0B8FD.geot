                            Abstract: 
                            A Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Level 4 sea surface temperature analysis produced daily on an operational basis at the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO) on a global 0.1 degree grid. The K10 L4 sea surface temperature analysis uses SST observations from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E), and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Imager. The age, reliability, and resolution of the data are used in the weighted average with the analysis tuned to represent SST at 1 meter depth. AVHRR Pathfinder 9km climatology is used when no new satellite SST retrievals are available after 34 days.
