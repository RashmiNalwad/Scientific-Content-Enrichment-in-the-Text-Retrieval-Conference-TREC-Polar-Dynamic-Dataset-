        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Turbulent fluxes of momentum, heat, water vapor, and CO2 had been measured from January to December in 2009 at a coastal region of the Antarctic King Sejong station. Eddy covariance system, consisting of 3-D sonic anemometer and open-path CO2/H2O gas analyzer was used for the measurement. Data were recorded on a data logger with sampling rate of 20 Hz.     
                        

                    
                    
                        
                            

                            Purpose: 
                            Turbulent flux measurements are used to better understand 1) the air-ocean-land-sea ice energy exchanges and 2) water and carbon dioxide gases.
