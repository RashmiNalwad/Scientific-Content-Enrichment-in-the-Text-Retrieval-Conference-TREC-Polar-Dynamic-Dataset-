Currently, only select resources
are accessible using the ECHO REST API and those resources are available for evaluation purposes.
The ECHO REST API aims to expose entities within ECHO as resources that can be accessed in a RESTful manner.
    Clients using the ECHO REST API can send and/or
receive messages in XML or JSON format. While the ECHO REST API may not provide for a pure-REST
architecture, it does allow for more integration and mashups with browser-based clients through
languages such as Javascript.

ECHO REST API Generated Documentation


Request URLs

Endpoints are defined for each resource and follow a naming convention based upon the
resource name.  For example,
https://api.echo.nasa.gov/echo-rest/users is the publicly available URL for ECHO users.


Request Messages

Clients must supply an ECHO "Echo-Token" HTTP Header with a value of a valid token in order to access protected resources to ECHO.

In each REST request, the HTTP body
may contain a request message in a format described below.

XML format

Clients must supply a "Content-Type" HTTP Header with a value of "application/xml" in order to send XML formatted requests to ECHO.
For requests in XML format,
the request body may contain one element named according to the resource name or may contain query parameters.  An element can have any number of child elements.
An XML request message to the tokens resource would then be formatted as follows:


  
    <token>
      <username>"username value"</username>
      <password>"password value"</password>
      <client_id>"client ID value"</client_id>
      <user_ip_address>"user IP address value"</user_ip_address>
      <act_as_user_name>"act as username value"</act_as_user_name>
      <provider>"behalf of provider value"</provider>
    </token>
  



JSON format

Clients must supply a "Content-Type" HTTP Header with a value of "application/json" in order to send JSON formatted requests to ECHO.
For requests in JSON format, the request may contain one object.  That object can have any number of fields (name/value pairs).
A JSON request message to the tokens resource would then be formatted as follows:


  
    {
      "username": "username value",
      "password": "password value",
      "client_id": "client ID value",
      "user_ip_address": "user IP address value"
      "act_as_user_name": "act as username value",
      "provider": "behalf of provider value"
    }
  



Response Messages

Every REST request has a corresponding REST response. Depending on the type of request, a response body may or may not
    contain content. A REST response body may contain a response message in a format described below.

XML format

Clients must supply an "Accept" HTTP Header with a value of "application/xml" in order to receive XML formatted responses from ECHO .


JSON format

Clients must supply an "Accept" HTTP Header with a value of "application/json" in order to receive JSON formatted responses from ECHO.
