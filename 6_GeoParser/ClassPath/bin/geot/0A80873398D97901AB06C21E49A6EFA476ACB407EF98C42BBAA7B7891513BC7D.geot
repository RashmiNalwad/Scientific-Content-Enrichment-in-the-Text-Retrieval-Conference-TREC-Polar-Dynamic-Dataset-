        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Annual total GPI rainfall is characterized by rainfall in excess of 3 
 m over the equatorial landmasses, the ITCZ and SPCZ, the eastern 
 portion of the Indian Ocean. The largest totals, in excess of 4 
 meters, are found near islands and the Isthmus of Panama. 
 
 The GPI rainfall estimates are prepared by Robert Joyce of NOAA NCEP, 
 and span the latitudes within 40  ... degrees latitude of the equator north 
 and south. This version of the GPI has been processed to reduce 
 longitudinal discontinuities associated with different satellites, and 
 other corrections have also been applied (Joyce and Arkin, 
 1997). Questions concerning the method should be directed to Robert 
 Joyce. (wd52rj@sgi15.wwb.noaa.gov) 
 
 The data: 
 
 - The data in netCDF format (1.2 Mbytes) (mm day-1). Obtained on 28 
 October 1996. Maps of &NaN&s are appended to the end of the file so 
 that the file is for complete years. GPI in terms of monthly rainfall 
 amounts in netCDF format (1.2 Mbytes) (mm month-1). Obtained on 28 
 October 1996. Maps of &NaN&s are appended to the end of the file so 
 that the file is for complete years. 
 
 - Climatological fields for 1986-95 in netCDF: 
 + monthly climatology 
 + annual total 
 
 All errors in the netCDF file are due to Todd Mitchell. 
 
 - The latest version of the data: The NCEP anonymous ftp directory has 
 both a README file and the data in binary format. The file names begin 
 with &gpi_mth_sat-merged_mmday_binxxxx& where xxxx is either .README 
 or some numbers to indicate the range of months included in the data 
 file.
