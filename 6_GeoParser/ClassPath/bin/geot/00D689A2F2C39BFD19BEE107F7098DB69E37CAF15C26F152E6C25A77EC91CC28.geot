Chapter 1.  Planetary Protection Categorization of Missions



1.1  Overview



1.1.1  Each planetary mission shall be assigned one or more PP categories based on the planetary protection priorities of each extraterrestrial solar system body and the mission plan. Planetary protection priorities and corresponding mission PP categories are given in Table 1. Each PP category has different planetary protection requirements, as described in Chapter 2 of this document. Mission PP categorization is determined by the PPO, upon request from the flight project as specified in section 2.1.2.

Mission PP Category
		
	
Not of direct interest for understanding the		
process of chemical evolution or where
exploration will not be jeopardized by
terrestrial contamination. No protection of
such planets is warranted, and no
requirements are imposed. 
			
Any
			
I
		
	
Of significant interest relative to the		
process of chemical evolution but only a
remote chance that contamination by
spacecraft could compromise future
investigations.
			
Any
			
II
		
	
Of significant interest relative to the		
process of chemical evolution and/or the
origin of life and for which scientific 
opinion provides a significant chance 
that contamination by spacecraft could 
compromise future investigations.
			
Flyby, Orbiter	
			
III
		
	
Of significant interest relative to the		
process of chemical evolution and/or the
origin of life and for which scientific 
opinion provides a significant chance 
that contamination by spacecraft could 
compromise future investigations.
			
Lander, Probe	
			
IV
		
	
Any Solar System Mission 
			
All Earth Return
			
V

								Unrestricted Earth Return

								Restricted Earth Return
		






Notes:	
1) For missions that target or encounter multiple planets, more than one PP category may be specified for planets targeted or encountered.




	2) For missions utilizing gravity assist by means of a flyby of another planet, requirements will typically be those for the target requiring the higher degree of protection.





1.2  Relationship to Planetary Flight Project's Project Plan



1.2.1   NPD 7120.5, NASA Space Flight Program and Project Management Requirements, requires the preparation of a Project Plan during the formulation of any flight project. The Project Plan shall specify how the project will incorporate any required planetary protection planning. The scope of planetary protection information to be included and the level of detail will vary with each Project Plan. In general, planetary protection planning should be described so as to be consistent with other elements of the Project Plan.  




1.2.2  The management approach, a part of each Project Plan, shall include the broad
management aspects of the planetary protection activities of the project. 




1.2.3  Required planetary protection planning documents, as specified in Chapter 2 of this document, shall be referenced in the Project Plan.


  
1.3  Deviations



1.3.1  The objectives of NASA's planetary protection policy, which is consistent with the policy and guidelines of the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR), shall be met at all times.




1.3.2  Deviations from the specific implementation approaches described in this NPR may be requested, as detailed in section 2.6 of this document.  Such requests shall be subject to the review and written approval of the PPO and, when appropriate, by the SMD AA, as specified below.
