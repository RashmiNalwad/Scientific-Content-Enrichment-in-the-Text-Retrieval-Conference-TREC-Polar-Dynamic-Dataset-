                            Abstract: 
                            The BOREAS TE-11 team collected several data sets in support of its efforts to characterize and interpret information on the sapflow, gas exchange, and lichen photosynthesis of boreal vegetation and meteorological data of the area studied. This data set contains measurements of assimilation and transpiration conducted at the OJP site during the growing seasons of 1993 and 1994.
