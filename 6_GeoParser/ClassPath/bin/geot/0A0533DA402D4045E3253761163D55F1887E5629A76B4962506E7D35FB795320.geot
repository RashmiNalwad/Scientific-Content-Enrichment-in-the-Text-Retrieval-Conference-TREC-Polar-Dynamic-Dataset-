        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            In 1970, an earthquake-induced rock and snow avalanche on Mt. Huascaran, Peru, buried the towns of Yungay and Ranrahirca. The magnitude 7.8 earthquake killed 66,794 and caused $250 million in property damage. Several towns were almost totally destroyed. With factors of landslides and floods, was one of the largest disasters in the Southern Hemisphere.     
                        

                    
                    
                        
                            

                            Purpose: 
                            To provide long-term scientific data stewardship for the Nation's geophysical data, ensuring quality, integrity, and accessibility
