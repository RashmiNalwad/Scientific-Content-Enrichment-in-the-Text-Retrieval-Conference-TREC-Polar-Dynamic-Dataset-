                            Abstract: 
                            This dataset contains the results from studies of the Weddell Seal (Lepotonychotes weddellii) in the Vestfold Hills region, Antarctica. Results from tagging surveys, photographs and aerial surveys since 1973 are reported. Numbers, life stage, sex, moult stage and migration patterns have been reported. Fecal samples have been collected and from the otoliths, vertebrae, cephalopod beaks and crustacean remains, the diets and feeding habits have been investigated. Many of the results are reported in the document. 
 
 This metadata record encompasses ASAC projects 89, 95 and 199 (ASAC_89, ASAC_95, ASAC_199).

            Various studies have been conducted on Weddell Seals in the Vestfold Hills, with directed work beginning in 1973 with the initiation of a tagging program and occasional aerial censuses. The referenced documentation provides information, methods, results and discussion about seal tagging, breeding, seal movements, moulting, aerial censuses, and diet.
