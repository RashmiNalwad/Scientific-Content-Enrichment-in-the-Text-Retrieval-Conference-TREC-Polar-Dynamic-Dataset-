        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The INSPIRE Geoportal Metadata Editor is a web application to create INSPIRE-compliant metadata in any of 22 European languages. It has been developed by the Joint Research Centre as part of the EuroGEOSS project (www.eurogeoss.eu). It is therefore a research outcome and not a production tool. This implementation allows to describe a spatial data set, a spatial data set series or a spatial data  ... service compliant with the standards ISO 19115:2003 (corrigendum 2003/Cor.1:2006)ii and ISO 19119:2005iii. It is therefore an implementation of the INSPIRE Metadata Technical Guidelines based on these two ISO standards, and published on the INSPIRE web site3. This editor builds on the experience acquired in the development of the INSPIRE Metadata Implementing Rules, and includes the INSPIRE Metadata Validator Service available from the INSPIRE EU Geo-portal (http://www.inspire-geoportal.eu/). This editor is also an Open Source evolution of the one currently available through the eugeoportal, with extended features on semantic queries. The editor is also available through the Open Source Observatory & Repository Europe (www.osor.eu).
