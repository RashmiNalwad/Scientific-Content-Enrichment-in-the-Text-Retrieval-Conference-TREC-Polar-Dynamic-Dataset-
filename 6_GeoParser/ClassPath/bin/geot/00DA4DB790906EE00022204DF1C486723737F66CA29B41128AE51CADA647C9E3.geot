		 	Climate Simulation Computer
                    Becomes More Powerful

                    More powerful computers needed to process the sophisticated
                    computer models used in climate forecasts are now being developed
                    at Goddard.

		 	GEOS-5 Based Visualization Among
                    Wired's Best of 2009

                    A visualization of a GEOS-5 atmospheric carbon cycle simulation conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has been highlighted in the list of the Best Science Visualization Videos of 2009 by Wired magazine. The visualization was produced at ORNL by Jamison Daniel and David Erickson.

		 	Super-Eruptions, Climate and
                    Human Survival

                    Explosive volcanic eruptions can cool climate for a short
                    period, but can a super-eruption such as occurred 74 thousand
                    years ago lead to ice sheet formation?

		 	Particles Multi-Task to Change
                    Climate

                    Tiny particulate matter in the atmosphere can both warm and
                    cool the climate. Which effect is dominant, and will the
                    balance change as the atmosphere warms due to greenhouse
                    gases?

		 	Climate Change Will Make for
                    Uneven Ozone Recovery

                    New research by NASA suggests the ozone layer of the future
                    is unlikely to look much like the past because greenhouse
                    gases are changing the dynamics of the atmosphere.

		 	Experiment May Help Forecast
                    Deadly Cyclones

                    NASA satellite data and a new modeling approach could improve
                      weather forecasting and save more lives when future cyclones
                      develop.

		 	GEOS-5 CloudSat Intercomparisons

                    A new study utilizes global analyses of the atmosphere obtained
                      from the new GEOS-5 Data Assimilation System (DAS) developed
                      for GMAO's Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research
                      and Applications (MERRA) to examine the relationships between
                      cloud parameters observed by the CloudSat satellite and
                      predictors of convective cloud structure derived from MERRA
                      re-analyses.

		 	Looking Both Ways at Pollution

                    Regulation of pollutants often treats their air quality and
                      climate change effects separately, but a unified approach
                      may produce better results.

		 	Getting a Grip On Ice Sheet
                    Changes

                    To better understand how climate change will affect the Greenland
                    ice sheet, scientists modeled the melting Laurentide ice
                    sheet of 9000 years ago.

                    Dr. Michael Bosilovich's article entitled "NASA's Modern
                    Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications:
                    Integrating Earth Observations" has been published in
                    Earthzine, an on-line magazine about Earth Science, produced
                    by the IEEE Committee on Earth Observation (ICEO).
