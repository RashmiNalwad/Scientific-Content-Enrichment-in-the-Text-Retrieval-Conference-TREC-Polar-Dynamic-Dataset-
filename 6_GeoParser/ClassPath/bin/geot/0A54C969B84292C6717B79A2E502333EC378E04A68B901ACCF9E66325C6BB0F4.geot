			On Monday evening, January 26 from 10 p.m. to midnight CST Marshall scientists will observe the large Asteroid 2004 BL86 as it passes by Earth. The public is welcome to follow their observations via the Marshall Ustream feed

The asteroid will safely pass about three times the distance of Earth to the moon, or approximately 745,000 miles (1.2 million kilometers) from Earth. Scientists have been tracking the path of the asteroid for 11 years and know its orbit well. Asteroid 2004 BL86 will not approach Earth this close again for at least 200 years.

This is a rare opportunity for observation. Hope you will join us as we observe the flyby.

Go here for more information about Asteroid 2004 BL86.

				Did NASA really just post a picture of a comet in a blog entry about an asteroid fly-by?

				You might want to mention that the image you used is a comet (looks like the most recent Comet Lovejoy), not as asteroid- the observations of 2004 BL86 advertised in this post will not look anything like this.

				we should expect more near pass asteroids  which can hit earth with massive speed , damage earth and wipe out life. To survive this kind of situations we should deploy technology and weapons ready and stand by .
