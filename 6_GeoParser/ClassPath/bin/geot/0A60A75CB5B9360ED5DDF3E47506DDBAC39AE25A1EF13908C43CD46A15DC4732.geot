        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Monitoring of sediment and crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) was 
 conducted in order to satisfy monitoring requirements set forth in the 
 James River Wauna Mill's National Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) 
 Permit (Tetra Tech 1992). Samples were collected from five sites to 
 evaluate the accumulation of dioxins and furans in sediment and 
 crayfish. Sediment and crayfish sampling primarily  ... focused on 
 locations downriver from the location of the outfall pipe. 
 
 Sediment samples were collected and analyzed for seventeen 
 dioxin/furan congeners, particle size distribution, total solids, and 
 total organic carbon. Data are presented on a dry weight basis and 
 TOC-normalized values are also provided in the report. Sampling 
 station latitude and longitude were recorded from geographic 
 coordinates provided by a Trimble Navigation Global Positioning System 
 receiver. 
 
 The area of study was the Lower Columbia River-Wauna. 
 
 Each sediment sample consisted of a composite of at least four grab 
 samples. Surface sediments (top 2 cm) were transferred to a stainless 
 steel bowl and homogenized with a stainless steel spatula. The 
 samples were placed in jars and stored on ice except for the samples 
 designated for TOC analysis. These samples were stored on dry ice. 
 
 Target analytes were Seventeen dioxin and furan congeners. 
 Conventional analyses included particle size, total solids, and total 
 organic carbon (TOC). 
 
 Analytical techniques included Dioxins and furans (EPA Method 1613A), 
 TOC (modified EPA Method 415.1), total solids (EPA Method 160.3.), 
 particle size (Puget Sound Estuary Program Protocols). All results 
 are reported on a dry weight basis. 
 
 The information for this metadata was taken from the Columbia River 
 Basin: Sediment Database Abstracts.

            Data were reviewed by Dr. William Luksemburg of Alta Analytical 
 Laboratory. The review included all ion chromatograms, initial and 
 continuing calibrations, column performance check mixes, calculations 
 of positive values and detection limits, ion abundance ratios for 
 internal/surrogate/recovery  ... standards and positive natives, matrix 
 spikes and duplicates, and calculation of lipid content. No data were 
 qualified based upon review of QA/QC data. Method blank, laboratory 
 control sample, internal standard, and detection limit data were 
 included in the report. The only qualifier code used in the data set 
 provided was "U" - Not detected. Value given is the detection limit. 
 Comparisons between sediment and crayfish tissue contaminant data 
 collected for this study are possible as the sampling locations for 
 crayfish correspond to sediment sampling sites. All data entered in 
 the database were reviewed for data entry errors. All detected errors 
 were corrected.
