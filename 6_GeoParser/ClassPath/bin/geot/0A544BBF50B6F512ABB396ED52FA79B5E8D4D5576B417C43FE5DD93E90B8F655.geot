        Summary


        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The Climatological Data Land Model (dlnd) functions as the land component in a 
 CCSM configuration. The dlnd land component interacts with the coupler just 
 like any land model would, but it is not an active model, rather, it takes land 
 data from an input data file and sends it to the coupler, ignoring any forcing 
 data received from the coupler. Typically the input data file contains mean 
 monthly  ... data generated by an active CCSM land model (it's unlikely that real 
 world observations exist for all the required fields). Such a "dummy" land 
 model is useful for doing ocean + ice spinup runs. 
 
 The CCSM Climatological Data Land Model, version 6.0 (dlnd), was released in 
 June 2004, as part of the CCSM3.0 release. 
 
 CCSM coupled model is based on a framework which divides the complete climate 
 system into component models connected by a coupler. This design requires four 
 component models -- atmosphere, sea-ice, land, and ocean -- each connected to 
 the Coupler, and each exchanging data with the Coupler only.

Description: 

The CCSM3.0 coupled model, released in June, 2004, provides the community with 
 a coupled model framework for carrying out climate simulations. Upgrades from 
 CCSM2.0.1 release can be found in the Introduction section of the Users Guide 
 CCSM coupled model is based on a framework which divides the complete climate 
 system into component models connected by a coupler. This design requires four
 
 component models -- atmosphere, land, ocean, and sea-ice -- each connected to 
 the coupler, and each exchanging data with the coupler only. From a software 
 engineering point of view, the CCSM is not a particular climate model, but a 
 framework for building and testing various climate models for various 
 applications. In this sense, more than any particular component model, the 
 coupler defines the high-level design of CCSM software.
