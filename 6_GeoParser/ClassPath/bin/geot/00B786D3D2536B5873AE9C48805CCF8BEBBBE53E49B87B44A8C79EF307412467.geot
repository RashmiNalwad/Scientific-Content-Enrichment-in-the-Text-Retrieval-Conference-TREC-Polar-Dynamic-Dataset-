                            Abstract: 
                            HUFPrint is a computer program that extracts and displays information about model structure and hydraulic properties from the input data for a model built using the Hydrogeologic-Unit Flow (HUF) Package of the U.S. Geological Survey’s MODFLOW program for modeling ground-water flow. HUFPrint reads the HUF Package and other MODFLOW input files, processes the data by hydrogeologic unit and by model  ... layer, and generates text and graphics files useful for visualizing the data or for further processing. For hydrogeologic units, HUFPrint outputs such hydraulic properties as horizontal hydraulic conductivity along rows, horizontal hydraulic conductivity along columns, horizontal anisotropy, vertical hydraulic conductivity or anisotropy, specific storage, specific yield, and hydraulic-conductivity depth-dependence coefficient. For model layers, HUFPrint outputs such effective hydraulic properties as horizontal hydraulic conductivity along rows, horizontal hydraulic conductivity along columns, horizontal anisotropy, specific storage, primary direction of anisotropy, and vertical conductance. Text files tabulating hydraulic properties by hydrogeologic unit, by model layer, or in a specified vertical section may be generated. Graphics showing two-dimensional cross sections and one-dimensional vertical sections at specified locations also may be generated. HUFPrint reads input files designed for MODFLOW–2000 or MODFLOW–2005.
