        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            This data set consist of ground truth measurements of snow, sea ice and ice shelf at Ross Island, Antarctica. In the study of microwave remote sensing, ground truth measurements play an important role towards verifying the accuracy of theoretical models. It is essential to understand the electrical property and structure of the medium that is to be scanned by the radar as these parameters greatly affect the microwave backscatter return signals. Measurement of these parameters provide vital information to aid in the development and verification of the theoretical models.
