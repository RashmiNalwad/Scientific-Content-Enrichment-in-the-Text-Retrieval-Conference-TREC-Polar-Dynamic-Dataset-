        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            This award supports a project to use two new scanning fluorimeters to map microbial concentrations vs depth in the WAIS Divide ice core as portions of it become available at NICL, and selected portions of the GISP2 ice core for inter-hemispheric comparison. Ground-truth calibrations with microbes in ice show that the instruments are sensitive to a single cell and can scan the full length of a 1-meter core at 300-micron intervals in two minutes. 
 
 This research is supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Office of Polar Programs (OPP) Division of Antarctic Science: Glaciology Program.     
                        

                    
                    
                        
                            

                            Purpose: 
                            The goals of these studies will be to exploit the discovery that microbes are transported onto ice, in clumps, several times per year and that at rare intervals (not periodically) of ~10^4 years, a much higher flux, sometimes lasting &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;1 decade, reaches the ice. From variations ranging from seasonal to millennial to glacial scale in the arrival time distribution  ... of phototrophs, methanogens, and total microbes in the Antarctic and Arctic ice, the investigators will attempt to determine oceanic and terrestrial sources of these microbes and will look for correlations of microbial bursts with dust concentration and temperature proxies. In addition the project will follow up on the discovery that the rare instances of very high microbial flux account for some of the"gas artifacts" in ice cores - isolated spikes of excess CH4 and N2O that have been discarded by others in previous climate studies. With the one-year no-cost extension that was granted, Ryan Bay was able to obtain a high-resolution dust log of the entire WAIS Divide borehole to 3329.8 m, which yielded an approximate age of 62,000 years.

                                These are preliminary data from one of three optical logs we made at WAIS Divide with the laser dust logger in December 2011, in the clear ice at depths between 1403.58 m and 3329.8 m (22 MB). Depths have been corrected to match the core, to an accuracy of &lt;5 cm typical and ~20 cm maximum, using tie points known from visual core assays. This accuracy should improve after we perform followup investigations at NICL. Optical intensity is in arbitrary units and can be linearly scaled to conform to other Antarctic dust proxies.
