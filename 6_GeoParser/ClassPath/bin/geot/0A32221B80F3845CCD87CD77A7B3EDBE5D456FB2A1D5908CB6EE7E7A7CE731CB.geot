Documentation Errors in the Last Version Of the HDF-EOS User's Guide:

The following 3 errors were found in the HDF-EOS User's Guide by Bob 
Wells (thanks for your diligence, Bob). They have been fixed and will 
be seen in their corrected form in the next version (which will be 
released with SCF Toolkit 5.2.7 and HDF-EOS 2.7).

The 3 errors, as Bob pointed them out, were:

> > [Page] 2-63 SWdefvrtregion
> > The array 'freq' is not declared (or assigned in the Fortran example)

Fix: The array 'freq', will be declared in the next version of the 
document.

> > [Page] 2-67 SWextractperiod
> > 'datbuf' is used for 'buffer'
> > 'swid'   is used for 'swathid' (C)
> > The 'swathid' argument is apparently missing from Fortran 'swextper'

Fix: The 'swathid' argument will be declared, in the identified 
location, in the next version of the document.

> > 2-94 SWupdateidxmap
> > 'index' is used for 'indexin'
> > 'index_region' is used for 'indexout'
> > The Fortran declaration of 'swupimap' is missing the 'indices' 
> > argument.

Fix: The declaration of 'swupimap' will have the correct 'indices' 
argument in the next version of the document.
