        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            SEC will describe and quantify the key mechanisms by which variations in the solar wind and solar high-energy radiation affect the Earth's atmosphere, to determine whether or not these have a significant effect on the Earth's climate system. It will look at the atmosphere and geospace as a unified whole, opening the way to the development of more realistic numerical models of the climate system.  ... 
 
 Energy from the Sun drives the Earth's climate system. Measured variations in the total solar energy output are too small to have a significant direct effect on the climate. But the solar wind -the flux of energetic particles and magnetic fields streaming away from the Sun- and solar ultraviolet and X-ray emissions are highly variable, both as a result of events such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections, and on the timescale of the 11-year sunspot cycle. It has been widely speculated that these forms of solar output affect the Earth's climate system, but the mechanisms remain elusive. We need to quantify the solar influence to distinguish more clearly the various sources of climate change, including those caused by human activities. SEC will use radars, balloons, and ground-based instruments in the Antarctic to measure the effects of solar variability on energetic particles, atmospheric chemistry and electric fields, winds, tides, and planetary waves from the troposphere to the thermosphere. Ground-based observations will be combined with satellite data to obtain a global view. To complement these observations and assess the global impact, we intend to develop a new model of the radiation belts and link it to existing atmospheric chemistry and General Circulation Models. SEC will link with CACHE, ACES and COMPLEXITY. 
    
                        

                    
                    
                        
                            

                            Purpose: 
                            Objectives 
 * Quantify the key mechanisms of indirect links between the Sun and the Earth's atmosphere 
 	o via solar and radiation belt particles 
 	o via the geo-electric field 
 	o via atmospheric waves 
 * Determine how the effect of solar variability may be amplified through those links and the significance for climate 
 * Determine the evolution of atmospheric change over time due to indirect influences, on different time scales and at different epochs
