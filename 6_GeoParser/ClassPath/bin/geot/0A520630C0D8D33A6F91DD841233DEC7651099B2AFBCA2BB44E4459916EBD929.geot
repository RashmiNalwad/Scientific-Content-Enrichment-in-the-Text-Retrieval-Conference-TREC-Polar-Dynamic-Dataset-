                Definition:

                
                    A phenomena wherein sea level rises above the normal tide level when
hurricanes or tropical storms move from the ocean along or across a
coastal region. This sea level rise can consists of three components, the
first of which results from low barometric pressure, i.e. the so-called
inverse barometer effect, where lower atmospheric pressure on the surface
of the water allows it to rise. The second component is wind set-up where
the winds drag surface
