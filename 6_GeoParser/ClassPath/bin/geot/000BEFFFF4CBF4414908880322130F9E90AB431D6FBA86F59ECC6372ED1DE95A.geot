	Description:
	
                  	Abstract:
	
                        
                        The Australian Antarctic Geodetic Network (AAGN) consists of geodetic positions (latitudes and longitudes) of permanent survey
                        marks on stable rock. The positions are computed from a network of older conventional geodetic survey observations (angles
                        and distances) and more recent high precision GPS measurements. All observations have been adjusted in terms of the global
                        coordinate system (the International Terrestrial Reference Frame) which is compatible with WGS84 for most practical applications.
                        The information held includes:
                        
                        Geodetic positions:
                        Unique station identifier,
                        Station name(s),
                        Station Type (e.g. trig station, bench mark, permanent tracking station),
                        Station coordinates (e.g. latitude and longitude and height),
                        Coordinate datum (e.g. ITRF, WGS84 or astronomical),
                        Coordinate epoch (e.g. 1998.0),
                        Coordinate accuracy,
                        
                        Related Site details:
                        Mark type (e.g. stainless steel pin in rock),
                        Status of mark (e.g. found, disturbed, destroyed),
                        Site description,
                        Allied information (e.g. photographs or sketches).
                        
                        Optical levelling connections from permanent GPS reference stations to tide gauges are also available.
                        
                        This work is part of ASAC project 1159 (ASAC_1159).
                        
                        A copy of a presentation detailing geodesy work undertaken as part of PCMEGA is available for download.

                        Because the AAGN only includes geodetic sites on stable rock, the coverage is limited to such areas. In addition, the majority
                        of the network is from Mawson to the South Prince Charles Mountains, west to Enderby Land and a spur to Davis. There are other
                        small quantities of control in the coastal regions of the AAT and at Casey and Commonwealth Bay. The AAGN is an accumulation
                        of geodetic survey observations since 1954. They have regularly been adjusted to provide positions on a variety of datums,
                        but the latest ITRF positions supersede all previous positions for these sites. All the geodetic sites in the AAGN are uniquely
                        linked to other attributes in a relational database. The accuracy of the positions depends on the vintage, type and geometric
                        position of the observations used. It varies from metres for older observations in difficult areas, to centimetres for positions
                        derived from modern, well configured GPS.
