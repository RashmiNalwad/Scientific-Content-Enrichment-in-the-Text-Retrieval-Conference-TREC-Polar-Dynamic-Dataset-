Topic SeaDAS / MODIS Direct Broadcast Support / How can i convert the units of Normalized water-leaving radiance at 551 nm ? (locked)

I'm analyzing images Normalized water-leaving radiance at 551 nm with a resolution of 4 km. For example: A20091212009128.L3m_8D_L551_4. I would like to know how to convert the drive mW cm ^ -2 a ^ -1 sr ^ -1  to  mg / l (milligrams per liter)?

That does not make physical sense.  You can't convert a radiance to a mass per unit volume.  What quantity are you trying to derive?  

Also, this is not a Direct Broadcast question.  A better forum would be Products and Algorithms.

sorry for posting in the wrong place. Indeed
I would like to get the concentration of suspended matter, because we have the relationship the greater the radiance greater the concentration of material in suspension. I would like to make this relationship in numbers?
