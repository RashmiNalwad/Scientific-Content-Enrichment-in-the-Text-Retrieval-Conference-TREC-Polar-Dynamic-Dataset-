        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The BROKE-West survey was conducted on voyage 3 of the Aurora Australis during the 2005-3006 season. It was intended to be a comprehensive biological and oceanographic survey of the region between 30 degrees and 80 degrees east. 
 
 A number of metadata records providing more detail about aspects of the voyage are linked off this metadata record. 
 
 Copies of the public summaries from the underlying  ... ASAC projects of the voyage are below: 
 
 A planned acoustic biomass survey for krill in CCAMLR Division 58.4.2 (South West Indian Ocean) in January-March 2006 will produce the data for a revised catch limit on the krill fishery. The survey will utilise a standardised design as adopted in previous biomass surveys in the CCAMLR Area and will consist of 11 parallel transects between 30 degrees and 80 degrees east. A full suite of ecological measurements will be conducted: physical and chemical oceanography, primary productivity, microbial diversity, zooplankton distribution and abundance, krill distribution, abundance and demographics, fish distribution, abundance and genetics, and seabird and cetacean distribution. 
 
 The three-dimensional ocean circulation from the 30 to 80 degrees E and 200nm from Antarctica is being studied through the use of direct measurements of velocity, temperature, salinity, oxygen, nutrients , chloro-flourocarbons, dissolved inorganic carbon and bio-geochemical cycles. This multi-disciplinary experiment (see also project 2655) will determine the circulation of the region, its relation to bio-geochemical cycles, carbon cycle and ecosystems. The temperature and salinity data will also be used to test for long term trends that could be related to climate change. 
 
 This work was completed as part of ASAC projects 2655 and 2679 (ASAC_2655, ASAC_2679). 
 
 A pdf copy of the proposed voyage track is available for download from the URL given below. 
 
 Two csv files detailing the locations (latitudes and longitudes), plus times and dates (UTC) of the trawl and ctd stations on the BROKE-West voyage are available for download from the URL given below. Additional comments (where applicable) about each station are also provided.
