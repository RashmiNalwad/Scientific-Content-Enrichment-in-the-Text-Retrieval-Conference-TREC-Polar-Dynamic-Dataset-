                Definition:

                
                    Methane (CH4) is a greenhouse gas and is seen in polar ice cores. From the ice
core record, it is known that methane rose rapidly whenever climate changed
from glacial to interglacial conditions (during "deglaciation"). Warming of
water bathing the seafloor could have led to large-scale release of methane
from the melting of methane ice.
