        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The major objectives of this project are as follows: 
 
 1. To determine the composition and distribution of algal flora from a wide 
 range of habitats, which provide a conductive niche for algal population in 
 Antarctica. 
 2. To compare the Antarctic and tropical algal flora, in order to determine the 
 degree of species endemism based on evolutionary process. 
 3. To study the important role of habitat  ... specificity in determining the 
 composition of diatom assemblages. 
 4. To test the utility and suitability of diatom community structure as 
 indicators of environmental stress. 
 
 This is done by: 1. Conducting an ecological survey of microalgal distribution 
 at Australian Antarctic station sites by looking into several types of habitat. 
 2. Identifying the microalgae samples collected based on morphology using light 
 microscopy and SEM. 3. Comparing the algae community, structure and 
 distribution from the tropics. 
 
 The principal milestones of the project are as follows: 1. Information of 
 microalgal distribution at several sites in Antarctica. 2. Collection of 
 microalgae cultures. 3. Completion of identification of Antarctic microalgae. 
 In collaboration with the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) we have gone on 
 an expeditions to Australian Antarctic Station of Casey and Davis. Collection 
 of samples was made from various sources such as water, snow and soil and we 
 have established a list of microalgae species in our collection. Comparative 
 studies on the species diversity and distribution with tropical microalgae 
 communities are being conducted. Physiological studies are currently in 
 progress.
