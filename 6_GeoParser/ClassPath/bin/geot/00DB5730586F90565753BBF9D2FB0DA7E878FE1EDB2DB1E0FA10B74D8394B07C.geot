                            Abstract: 
                            SAGE III Meteor-3M L1B Solar Event Transmission Data are Level 1B pixel group transmission profiles for a single solar event. 
 
 The Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III (SAGE III) obtains profile measurements of aerosol extinction, ozone, water vapor, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen trioxide, chlorine dioxide, clouds, temperature and pressure in the mesosphere, stratosphere, and upper  ... troposphere with a vertical resolution of 0.5 - 1 km resolution. 
 
 SAGE III was a fourth generation, satellite-borne instrument and a crucial element in NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) . The instrument was launched on the Russian Meteor-3M spacecraft in December 2001. The Meteor-3M mission, along with the SAGE III mission, was terminated on March 6, 2006, because of a power supply system failure resulting in loss of communication with the satellite. 
 
 The newest SAGE mission, SAGE III on ISS, is scheduled to launch in 2015. Plans include sending a copy of the SAGE III instrument to the International Space Station aboard a commercial Space X flight.
