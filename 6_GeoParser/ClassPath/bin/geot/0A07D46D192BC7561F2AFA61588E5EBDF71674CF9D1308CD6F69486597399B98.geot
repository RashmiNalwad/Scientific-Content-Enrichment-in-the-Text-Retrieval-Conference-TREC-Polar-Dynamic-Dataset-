                            Abstract: 
                            Since the 1970s, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has routinely established and updated standard methodologies for performing coastal hazard assessments of fine-scale wave phenomena associated with hurricane storm surges or northeaster flooding effects. These methodologies include storm-induced erosion treatments, wave height analyses, and wave runup analyses. 
 
 CHAMP is a  ... Windows-interfaced Visual Basic language program that allows the user to enter data, perform coastal engineering analyses, view and tabulate results, and chart summary information for each representative transect along a coastline within a user-friendly graphical interface. With CHAMP, the user can import digital elevation data; perform storm-induced erosion treatments, wave height analyses, and wave runup analyses; plot summary graphics of the results; and create summary tables and reports in a single environment.

        Access Constraints
        
            The minimum requirements for installing and running CHAMP are: 
 
 -IBM compatible PC computer (a 100 MHz or higher processor is recommended) 
 -Microsoft Windows 95, 98, NT, ME, 2000 or XP operating system 
        
    



            
            
            







    
        Use Constraints
        
            Users of previous versions of CHAMP will need to modify their databases by selecting each individual MG Card and reselecting the plant type from the dropdown menu. This action is necessary to change previously entered plant parameter values to zeros, which will enable the WHAFIS program to use program-provided default values.
