 significant use of these data sets. Specific questions about the 
 data should also be directed to the primary author. 
 Authors addresses are given in the book on pages xi-xiv. 
 
 File 1: CH1.DAT: Data from Tables 2.1 and 2.2, Annual indices of 
 summer ice severity in eastern and western Hudson Bay, plus 
 additional data from Hudson Strait, and thermal indices for the 
 southeast coast of Hudson Bay. 
 
 File 2: CH6.DAT: Data from C. Pfister. Monthly temperature and 
 Precipitation indices used to construct Figure 6.4. 
 
 File 3: CH11.DAT: Data from W.C. Wang et al. Number of rain 
 days, daytime rain hours, and night-time rain hours from the 
 Qing-Yu-Lu for May, June and July, 1724-1903. 
 
 File 4: CH13.DAT: Data from Jones and Bradley. Monthly 
 temperature and precipitation data from some of the long-term 
 stations shown in Figures 13.1 and 13.2. Also seasonal and 
 annual temperature anomalies (from 1951-70) averages for northern 
 and southern hemisphere land areas (shown in Figures 13.3 and 
 13.4) and for COADS SST data for the northern and southern 
 hemispheres (shown in Figure 13.5). 
 
 File 5: CH15.dat: data from D'Arrigo and Jacoby. Reconstructed 
 mean annual temperatures for northern North America, from Figure 
 15.4. (Note: figure captions for Figs. 15.3 and 15.4 are reversed 
 in the book). 
 
 File 6: CH16.DAT: data from Meko. Standardised regional tree- 
 ring series for regions 0 to 9 (shown in Figure 16.1) and scores 
 of the first three eigenvectors from PCA on regional tree-ring 
 series, 1750-1964 (shown in Figure 16.3). 
 
 File 7: CH17.DAT: data from Cook et al. Obliquely rotated 
 drought factor scores based on 23 PDSI reconstructions for the 
 eastern United States (shown in Figure 17.3). 
 
 File 8: CH19.DAT: data from Briffa and Schweingruber. Ring width 
 chronologies for several sites around Lake Inari (northern 
 Finland) and the Tornetrask region of northern Sweden (shown in 
 Figure 19.2). Also contains data from Figures 19.4 and 19.7. 
 
 File 9: CH20.DAT: data from Graybill and Shiyatov. Reconstructed 
 June-July average temperatures at 65N, 70E (N.W. Russia) expressed 
 as departures from the 1951-70 average (shown in Figure 20.4). 
 
 File 10: CH23.DAT: data from Boninsegna. Data on reconstructed: 
 winter precipitation at Santiago de Chile; summer and winter 
 anticyclone positions and summer precipitation at Chiloe (shown 
 in Figure 23.2); summer temperatures in northern and central 
 Patagonia (Rio Alerce) and indices of summer temperature at 
 Ushuaia (shown in Figure 23.3); streamflows of Rivers Atuel, 
 Neuquen and Limay (shown in Figure 23.4). 
 
 File 11: CH24.DAT: data from Norton and Palmer. Reconstructed 
 climate and river flow data for New Zealand (shown in Figures 24.4 
 and 24.5). 
 
 File 12: CH25.DAT: data from Holdsworth et al. Mount Logan 
 oxygen isotope (delta O-18) and net accumulation data (meters of 
 water equivalent, per year) (shown in Figures 25.3 and 25.4). 
 Note: The title of this chapter should read: 'Ice core climate 
 signals from Mount Logan, Yukon, A.D. 1700-1987' (not 1897). 
 
 File 13: CH26.DAT: data from Tarussov. Net accumulation data 
 from Lomonosovfonna, Svalbard and Milcent, Greenland (shown in
