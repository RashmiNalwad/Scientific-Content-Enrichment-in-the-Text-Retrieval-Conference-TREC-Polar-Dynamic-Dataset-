        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Total concentrations of major and trace elements were determined in samples of 
 the epilithic lichen Umbilicaria decussata from 24 ice-free areas in coastal 
 Victoria Land (Antarctica) during 1991 - 2001. Overall average concentrations 
 of trace elements except Cd were the lowest ever reported for lichens of the 
 genus Umbilicaria. Specifically, the mean level of Pb in lichen  ... from granitic 
 rock (0.46 +/- 0.18 mg/g-1 dry wt) was more than four times lower than the 
 lowest record in Arctic lichens. No impact of local human activities was 
 detected, but the elemental composition of U. decussata was affected by 
 entrapment of soil of rock dust particles and probably by uptake of soluble 
 elements from substrate. 
 
 Relationship between elements and their distributions patterns in the study 
 area indicated that the marine environment is the main source of major ions and 
 perhaps of Cd in lichens. Accumulation of P was detected in samples from 
 coastal sites frequented by seabirds. Although the present results can be taken 
 as baseline levels of major and trace elements in Antarctic U. decussata from 
 substrates with very different geochemical features, further research is 
 necessary to evaluate the relative element contribution from each substrate 
 with respect to those from snow, marine aerosol, salt encrustation and guano.

            A composite sample of U. decussata thalli was collected from boulders and rock 
 outcrops in 24 hours. In each site, a sample of surface soil was collected. In 
 the laboratory of Baia Terra Nova station, the lichen and soil samples were 
 dried at 40 degrees C for 36 hrs. The lichens were then sorted to remove 
 extraneous materials and dead or senescent  ... tissue. Soil samples were sorted to 
 remove gravel and larger organic debris and then sieved through a 0.20 mm 
 screen. Once in Italy samples were mineralized in clean Teflon vessels under 
 pressure with 2.5 ml conc. HNO3 at 120 degrees C for 8 hrs. A total of 13 
 elements were analyzed in the mineralized samples. Al, Fe, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, 
 Cu, P and Zn concentrations were determined by air/acetylene Flame Atomic 
 Absorption spectrometry (FAAS) and by Inductively coupled Plasma Atomic 
 Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES). Those of Cd, Cr and Pb determined by 
 Electrothermal Atomic Absorption Spectrometry with Zeeman correction (ZETAAS).
