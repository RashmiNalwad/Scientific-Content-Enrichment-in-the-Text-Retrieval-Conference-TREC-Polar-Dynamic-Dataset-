        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The basic data used in this project is the (US) National Centers for Environmental Prediction global reanalysis data set, and we have used the area south of 30S. Two primary data sets have come from the project. The first is the amplitude and phase of the surface semiannual oscillation over the Southern Hemisphere. The second is comprehensive statistics on cyclone behaviour over the hemisphere  ... over this period. The project is exploring the links between the variability of these parameters. These links have been quantified by producing data sets of correlations and time series analyses. 
 
 In this project, the NCEP reanalysis datasets were sourced from: NOAA/National Weather Service, National Centers for Environmental Prediction (5200 Auth Road, Camp Springs, Maryland, 20746 USA). 
 
 Two NCEP reanalysis data sets were used in this study. The first was NCEP/NCAR, with 6-hourly data available from 1958 (see the URL provided below for further information). The second was the NCEP/DOE set, with 6-hourly data available from 1979 (see the URL provided below for further information). 
 
 In this project the following model/analysis was applied: 
 
 Application of The University of Melbourne cyclone tracking scheme (Simmonds et al., 2003, Monthly Weather Review, 131, 272-288) and a broad range of statistical tests. Brief details are provided in the Summary. See the link for the pdf document for more detailed information. 
 
 These complex statistical analyses were run over the entire length of the project (1999/2000 - 2000/01). They were run on the Sun Workstation cluster in the School of Earth Sciences, The University of Melbourne.
