                            Abstract: 
                            Bryophyte Ecophysiology - response to water and nutrients. 
 
 This project is also related to ASAC project 1313 (ASAC_1313) - Impact of global climate change on Antarctic flora: long-term monitoring and ecophysiological studies of bryophyte community dynamics in the Windmill Islands - and to the State of the Environment indicator Windmill Islands terrestrial vegetation dynamics  ... (SOE_Windmill_Island_veg). 
 
 File descriptions 
 
 All files are associated with a multiseason manipulative field experiment investigating the effect of increased water and nutrient availability in Antarctic terrestrial communities. For full details refer to Chapter 4 in Wasley (2004). 
 
 A number of scans relating to the pilot data collected in this project are available for download. Currently these are low resolution scans, but will be updated in time to better quality images. 
 
 Study Site 
 The experiment was conducted in Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) 135, on Bailey Peninsula, approximately 1 km east of Casey Station. The site was located on the western edge of a meltlake, at 66 degrees 16.03' S, 110 degrees 32.53' E.

 These datasets include: 
 
 Excel spreadsheets of data - chlorophyll a fluorescence, Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM), Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPC), Sugars, Turf Water Content (TWC). 
 
 A word document detailing each of the spreadsheets. 
 
 A copy of a thesis produced from this work.
