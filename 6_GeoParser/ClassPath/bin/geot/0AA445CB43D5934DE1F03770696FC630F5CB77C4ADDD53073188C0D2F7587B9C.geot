On November 29, 2002, Sicilyâ€™s Mt. Etna continued to produce an ash plume visible from space. This image of the brownish plume streaming southward from the volcano and a thermal signature (red outline) were captured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua satellite. This most recent eruption of Etna began October 27, 2002, and has continued for the past month. On the 29th, lava continued to pour from vents high on the southern flank of the mountain.
