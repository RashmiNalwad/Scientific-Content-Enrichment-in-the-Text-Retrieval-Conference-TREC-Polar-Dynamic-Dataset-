        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The Office of Polar Programs and polar geologists recognized the value of 
 saving rock collections from Antarctica and created the United States Polar 
 Rock Repository at Ohio State University. This facility opened in October, 
 2003. Since that time, we have cataloged more than 6100 rock samples. The 
 data associated with these samples, along with a rock magnetic database 
  ... representing more than 1700 sites and a photo/map archive are now available to 
 the community via the internet at: 
 http://bprc.osu.edu/emuwebusprr/pages/usprr/Query.php . 
 
 The USPRR advances knowledge about polar geology in regions that are often not 
 well known because of logistical and ice-cover constraints. The presence of a 
 facility like the USPRR lessens the environmental impact in polar regions by 
 encouraging researchers to assess samples in the USPRR collection first. Our 
 facility provides a way for teachers and children to learn about Antarctica via 
 our website and by visiting us (we have more than 1000 visitors/yr). For 
 children in the K-12 age range, we have created these links on our website: a 
 Virtual Tour of the Repository, Meet the Curators, Kids Space and Frequently 
 Asked Questions as a way of learning about Antarctica. Cataloging of samples 
 provides university students with an opportunity to learn about the geology of 
 Antarctica as well as learning new skills in digital imaging, curation and 
 databases. Our results are broadly disseminated to the scientific community and 
 public via our website.

        Quality
        
            Information about the rock samples come from field notes, theses, publications 
 or from data tables filled out by the sample collector. Precise geographical 
 information is lacking for rock samples collected prior to 1990, for this we 
 have place names and field map information.

    Use Constraints
    
        All users who have received samples from the USPRR must: 
 1) Acknowledge the USPRR in any proposal or publication (including annual 
 and final NSF reports) using the following wording: "This research used 
 samples and/or data provided by the United States Polar Rock Repository 
 (USPRR). The USPRR is  ... sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation." 
 2) Acknowledge the original collector of the sample(s). 
 3) Include the "United States Polar Rock Repository" as keywords provided to 
 the journal or book publisher of a manuscript using any USPRR samples or data. 
 4) Provide to the repository library, one reprint of any published paper that 
 used information obtained from USPRR for the repository library. 
 
 Users of data from the USPRR web site should acknowledge the USPRR as the 
 source in all proposals, reports and publications.
