        Botswana, located in central southern  Africa, is a land rich in natural resources.  Diamonds,  platinum, gold, coal, iron ore, silver, copper, nickel,  salt, soda ash, and potash are all mined there and form the  backbone of the country’s economy.  But while the land  holds great mineral wealth, it isn’t suited to  agriculture, as this true-color Moderate  Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) image  shows.  The country is on a mostly semiarid plateau;  droughts are common, despite a subtropical climate.
In the northwestern corner of the country, the Okavango  River widens into a huge delta that feeds substantial  marshland.  MODIS detected a couple of fires in the Delta;  they are marked in red.  Southeast of the Delta are the vast  Makgadikgadi salt flats; they are white and gray against the  tan plateau and reddish hills.  In the southwestern corner  of the country, the Kalahari Desert stretches for hundreds  of miles.
Compared to the relatively barren Botswna, South Africa  (south and east of Botswana), blooms in a riot of earthy  summer colors.  The Ghaap Plateau and Asbestos Mountains are  a striking orange-red color bordering the Orange River  (lower left corner), while the lands around Johannesburg and  Pretoria (middle right) show the lush verdant color of  vegetation.  In northeastern South Africa, the land shows in  a range of purples, corals, and greens.  Small fires are  scattered throughout this portion of the image, some of  which show visible smoke-plumes. This image was taken on  December 1, 2003 by the Terra satellite.
