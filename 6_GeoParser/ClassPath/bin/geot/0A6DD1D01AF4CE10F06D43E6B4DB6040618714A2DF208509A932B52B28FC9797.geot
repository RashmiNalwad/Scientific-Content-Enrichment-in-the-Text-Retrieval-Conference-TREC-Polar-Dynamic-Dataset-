        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                             The 500 meter MODIS Level 1B Near Real Time (NRT) data set contains calibrated and geolocated 
 at-aperture radiances for 7 discrete bands located in the 0.45 to 2.20 micron 
 region of the electromagnetic spectrum. These data are generated from the MODIS 
 Level 1A scans of raw radiance and in the process converted to geophysical 
 units of W/(m^2 um sr).  ... In addition, the Earth Bi-directional Reflectance 
 Distribution Function (BRDF) may be determined for these solar reflective bands 
 through knowledge of the solar irradiance (e.g., determined from MODIS solar 
 diffuser data, and from the target illumination geometry). Additional data are 
 provided including quality flags, error estimates and calibration data. 
 
 Visible, shortwave infrared, and near infrared measurements are only made 
 during the daytime, while radiances for the thermal infrared region (bands 
 20-25, 27-36) are measured continuously. 
 
 Channel locations for the MODIS 500 meter data are as follows: 
 
 Band Center Wavelength (um) Primary Use 
 ---- ---------------------- ----------- 
 1 0.620 - 0.670 Land/Cloud Boundaries 
 2 0.841 - 0.876 Land/Cloud Boundaries 
 3 0.459 - 0.479 Land/Cloud Properties 
 4 0.545 - 0.565 Land/Cloud Properties 
 5 1.230 - 1.250 Land/Cloud Properties 
 6 1.628 - 1.652 Land/Cloud Properties 
 7 2.105 - 2.155 Land/Cloud Properties 
 
 Channels 1 and 2 have 250 m resolution, channels 3 through 7 have 500 m 
 resolution. However, for the MODIS L1B 500 m product, the 250 m band radiance 
 data and their associated uncertainties have been aggregated to 500 m 
 resolution. Thus the entire channel data set has been co-registered to the same 
 spatial scale in the 500 m product. Separate L1B products are available for the 
 250 m resolution channels (MOD02QKM) and 1 km resolution channels (MOD021KM). 
 For the latter product, the 250 m and 500 m channel data (bands 1 through 7) 
 have been aggregated into equivalent 1 km pixel values. 
 
 Spatial resolution for pixels at nadir is 500 km, degrading to 2.4 km in the 
 along-scan direction at the scan extremes. However, thanks to the overlapping 
 of consecutive swaths and respectively pixels there, the resulting resolution 
 at the scan extremes is about 1 km. A 55 degree scanning pattern at the EOS 
 orbit of 705 km results in a 2330 km orbital swath width and provides global 
 coverage every one to two days. A single MODIS Level 1B 500 m granule will 
 contain a scene built from 203 scans sampled 2708 times in the cross-track 
 direction, corresponding to approximately 5 minutes worth of data; thus 288 
 granules will be produced per day. Since an individual MODIS scan will contain 
 20 along-track spatial elements for the 500 m channels, the scene will be 
 composed of (2708 x 4060) pixels, resulting in a spatial coverage of (2330 km x 
 2040 km). Due to the MODIS scan geometry, there will be increasing scan overlap 
 beyond about 20 degrees scan angle. 
 
 To summarize, the MODIS L1B 500 m data product consists of: 
 
 1. Calibrated radiances, uncertainties and number of samples for (2) 250 m 
 reflected solar bands aggregated to 500 m resolution 
 
 2. Calibrated radiances and uncertainties for (5) 500 m reflected solar bands 
 
 3. Geolocation for 1km pixels, that must be interpolated to get 500 m pixel locations. 
 For the relationship of 1km pixels to 500m pixels, see the Geolocation ATBD http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/atbd/atbd_mod28_v3.pdf . 
 
 4. Calibration data for all channels (scale and offset) 
 
 5. Comprehensive set of file-level metadata summarizing the spatial, temporal and parameter 
 attributes of the data, as well as auxiliary information pertaining to instrument status and data quality characterization 
 
 Users requiring all geolocation and solar/satellite geometry fields at 
 1km resolution can obtain the separate MODIS Level 1 Geolocation product 
 (MOD03) from LAADS http://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/ . 
 
 The MODIS L1B 500 m data are stored in the Earth Observing System Hierarchical 
 Data Format (HDF-EOS) which is an extension of HDF as developed by the National 
 Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois. A 
 typical file size will be approximately 170 MB. 
 
 Environmental information derived from MODIS L1B measurements will offer a 
 comprehensive and unprecedented look at terrestrial, atmospheric, and ocean 
 phenomenology for a wide and diverse community of users throughout the world.

 The V004 Program Executable (PGE), for MODIS Level 1B products, has gone 
 through a series of revisions since the initial release of V4.0.0 in March of 
 2002. These include revisions to make it LINUX-compatible. The current version 
 is V4.0.9, which does not contain changes to the code that affect scientific 
 output. 
 
 Below is a brief overview of changes that affect scientific output in previous 
 versions (V4.0.0 to V4.0.7) of PGE code. The MCST web site, listed in the URL 
 section of this DIF, has a more detailed version of this information, including 
 revisions that do not affect scientific output. 
 
 Significant changes to Look Up Tables (LUT) used in Level 1B processing have 
 occurred. These include revising the Response-versus-Scan Angle (RVS) LUTs from 
 listing the RVS corrections to listing the quadratic coefficients used in 
 making the RVS correction. The coefficients are now calculated by interpolating 
 on the granule collection time and the RVS corrections are then generated using 
 the interpolated coefficients. Previously used Emissive and Reflective RVS LUT 
 tables were eliminated and new ones introduced.

Whereas the standard MODIS forward processing acquires 2-hour L0 files for Aqua and Terra from EDOS within 7-8 hours of real time, LANCE-MODIS acquires session-based L0 files from EDOS and the end of the session is available within 10-30 minutes after real time.
