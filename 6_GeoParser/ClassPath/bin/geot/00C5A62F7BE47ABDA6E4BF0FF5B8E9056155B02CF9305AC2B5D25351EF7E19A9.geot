High Energy Astrophysics Observatories


These Web pages describe all the high energy astronomy observatories, or
"missions," ever launched, excluding those solely dedicated to observing the
Sun. [If you are interested in cosmic microwave
background experiments, please check out this extensive list on the LAMBDA web
site]. 


The links to the left in the menu-bar are dedicated to the most notable
past and present X-ray and gamma-ray astronomy missions. The pages for
each mission include:


	a mission overview, 

	technical information on the instrumentation,

	a bibliography and 

	a gallery of images. 





They also contain a description of the available data if they are present in the
HEASARC archive. Information on other satellites carrying either an X-ray or a
gamma-ray telescope is available on the All Missions pages.

OSO-7

Orbiting Solar Observatory
performed X-ray all-sky survey.

Lifetime: 1971 - 1974






	







	



High energy astrophysics is a young discipline, whose 

history is only a few decades old, and requires space-borne
instruments to observe the X-ray
and 
gamma-ray sky.




	

X-ray Observatories



After the rocket experiments during the 1960s, the first X-ray Earth-orbiting explorers
were launched in the 1970s (Uhuru, SAS 3, Ariel5) followed in late 1970s early
1980s by larger missions (HEAO-1, Einstein, EXOSAT, and Ginga). Their scientific
outcome, in particular the first X-ray images taken by Einstein, lifted X-ray
astronomy into the mainstream of astronomical research. It is now known that nearly
every astronomical object from nearby comets to
distant 
quasars emits X-rays. In the 1990s the ROSAT survey detected more than 100,000 X-ray
objects, the ASCA mission made the first sensitive measurements of the X-ray spectra
from these objects, and RXTE studied their timing properties.  The late 1990's launch of
the Chandra and XMM-Newton observatories brought high-resolution imaging and
high-throughput capability to X-ray astronomy. These missions, combined with 
Suzaku/Astro-E2, launched in 2005, have opened new and exciting horizons in the 
journey of the X-ray astronomy exploration. 








	


Gamma-Ray Observatories


SAS 2 and Cos B, launched in the 1970s, made the first surveys of the gamma-ray sky,
followed by the Compton Gamma-ray Observatory in 1990 and more recently by INTEGRAL in 2002. 
Blazars, 
pulsars, and many unidentified sources in our galaxy are the gamma-ray emitters.  
Fermi (formerly GLAST), the latest gamma-ray observatory, is expected to resolve the diffuse emission and
make an all-sky survey with higher angular and energy resolution.

The mysterious 
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) discovered in the late 1960s by the Vela satellite, were
shown to be the most powerful explosions in the Universe and isotropically distributed,
thanks to the rapid response capability of BeppoSAX and the all-sky monitoring of CGRO.
Swift, launched in November 2004, is providing data on the GRBs prompt emission and 
their afterglows to allow the most comprehensive study on GRBs and determine their origin.
