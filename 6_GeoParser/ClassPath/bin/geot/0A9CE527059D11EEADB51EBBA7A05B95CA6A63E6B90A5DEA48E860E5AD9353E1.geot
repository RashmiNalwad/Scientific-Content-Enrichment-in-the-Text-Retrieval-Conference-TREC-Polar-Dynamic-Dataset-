        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The OPeNDAP Data Connector (ODC) is a program which allows you to search for 
 and retrieve datasets published by OPeNDAP data servers. OPeNDAP servers (also 
 known as DODS servers) located at major institutions around the world serve a 
 wide variety of data including: climatic data, satellite imagery, and ocean 
 sensor results. The ODC allows you to find these datasets, download them to 
 your machine,  ... save them, and import them into client applications like IDL, 
 Matlab, SPSS, Excel, or into databases such as Access and Oracle, and plot them 
 with advanced graphics capabilities. The ODC is your gateway to terabytes of 
 scientific data and imagery. 
 
 Features include the following: 
 
 * Search union list of hundreds of well-known OPeNDAP servers 
 * Search NASA's Global Change Master Directory 
 * Navigate server directories with intuitive interface 
 * Retrieve dataset structure specifications and field attributes/descriptions 
 * Sophisticated GUI for dataset querying 
 * Send output to text view, table view or plotter 
 * Plot pseudocolor, vector, line, scatter, histogram 
 * Plotter provides highly sophisticated color control and generation 
 * Plotter has built-in 1 km coastline with 0.04 km available by download 
 * Built-in image viewer 
 * Interprocess server allows external applications to communicate with the ODC, 
 to either retrieve fully qualified URLs or data values.
