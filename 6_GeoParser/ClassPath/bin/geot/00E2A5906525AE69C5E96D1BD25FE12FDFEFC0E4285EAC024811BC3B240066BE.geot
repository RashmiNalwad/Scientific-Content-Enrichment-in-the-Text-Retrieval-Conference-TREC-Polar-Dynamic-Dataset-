                Definition:

                
                    Thermal infrared Infrared radiation which has a wavelength between 3.0 μm and 100 μm. At normal environmental temperatures objects emit infrared between these wavelengths; hotter objects, such as fires, emit infrared at wavelengths shorter than thermal infrared. Compare REFLECTED INFRARED.
