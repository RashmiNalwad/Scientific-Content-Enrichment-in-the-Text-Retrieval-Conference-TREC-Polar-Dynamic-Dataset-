CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - NASA has awarded its Test and Operations Support Contract, or TOSC, to Jacobs Technology Inc. of Tullahoma, Tenn. Jacobs will provide overall management and implementation of ground systems capabilities, flight hardware processing and launch operations at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. These tasks will support the International Space Station, Ground Systems Development and Operations, and the Space Launch System, Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle and Launch Services programs.

	

	The contract begins March 1, 2013, following a two-month phase-in period beginning Jan. 2. The contract has a one-year, seven-month base period and options to extend the work through Sept. 30, 2022. The maximum potential value for the nine-year, seven-month cost-plus-award-fee contract is $1.37 billion if NASA exercises all options.

	

	Jacobs will provide services to meet NASA requirements, including support to the agency's programs, commercial entities and other government agencies. These services include launch vehicle, spacecraft and payload integration and processing; operations and development of associated processes and ground systems to support integration, processing and launch; servicing and testing of flight hardware; and launch of development and operational flights at Kennedy.

	

	Subcontractors working with Jacobs on the contract include Engineering Research and Consulting Inc., or ERC, of Huntsville, Ala. and Aerodyne Industries LLC, of Oldsmar, Fla.

	

	With the award of this contract, Kennedy is positioning itself for the next era of space exploration. Kennedy is transitioning to a 21st-century launch facility with multiple users, both private and government. A dynamic infrastructure is taking shape, designed to host many kinds of spacecraft and rockets sending people on America's next voyages in space.
