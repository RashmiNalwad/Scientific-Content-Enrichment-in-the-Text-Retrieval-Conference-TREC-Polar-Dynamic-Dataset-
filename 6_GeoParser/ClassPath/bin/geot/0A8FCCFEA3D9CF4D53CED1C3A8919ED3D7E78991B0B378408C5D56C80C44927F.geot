                            Abstract: 
                            The US Science Operator for the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) operated the drilling vessel JOIDES Resolution from 2004-2013 for worldwide expeditions numbering between 301 through 346. IODP was an international marine research program that explored Earth's history and structure recorded in seafloor sediments and rocks, and monitors subseafloor environments, building upon the earlier  ... successes of the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP), which revolutionized our view of Earth history and global processes through ocean basin exploration. IODP expanded the reach of these previous programs by using multiple drilling platforms, including riser, riserless, and mission-specific, to achieve its scientific goals. 
 The IODP was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and several countries, only the U.S. component of IODP data is represented in this archive. In 2010, the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) began receiving core data processed through the JANUS data system at TAMU for long-term archival, beginning with Expedition 301. In 2013, the first data from the new LIMS data system at TAMU reached the archive, beginning with Expedition 317. In addition to digital core data from the JANUS and LIMS systems, which is available online, core images and other scanned documents and images are also archived. Digital imagery is available on request, but not offered online due to its volume. 
    
                        

                    
                    
                        
                            

                            Purpose: 
                            Marine geological and geophysical research. Research into the deep biosphere and the subseafloor ocean; 
 Environmental change, processes and effects; and 
 Solid earth cycles and geodynamics.
