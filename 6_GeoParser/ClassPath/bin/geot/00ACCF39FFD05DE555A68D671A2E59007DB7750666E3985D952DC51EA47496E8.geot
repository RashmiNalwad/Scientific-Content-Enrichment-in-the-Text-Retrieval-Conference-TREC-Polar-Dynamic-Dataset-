                            Abstract: 
                            Taken from sections of the Report: 
 
 This report details the survey work carried out during Voyage 6 in March and April 1999 by LANDINFO staff on behalf of the Australian Antarctic Divisions Mapping Program. The main task of the survey team was to acquire aerial photography at Casey Station and surrounding areas as well as capturing aerial photography of Macquarie Island. Other tasks involved data  ... retrieval and installation of tide gauges at all ANARE stations. 
 
 The following team carried out the survey-mapping work: 
 Tom Gordon LANDINFO Surveyor 
 David Clements Antarctic Division assistant 
 
 David Clements was a returning expeditioner from Mawson Station who volunteered his assistance during the voyage. 
 
 Project Outline 
 
 Work was undertaken by LANDINFO for Antarctic Division in a number of operational areas on this voyage. The Aurora Australis departed from Fremantle on the 8th of March and sailed to Mawson, Davis, Casey and Macquarie Island. The principle areas of interest were to be Casey Station and Macquarie Island where aerial photography had been planned. At all the ANARE Stations work associated with the tide gauges was to be undertaken.

 Although it was disappointing not have the opportunity to undertake the aerial photography required at Casey another attempt at an earlier time next season would most likely prove more productive. Trying to capture aerial photography during the 1 or 2 day visits at this time of year is very dependant on having good  ... weather conditions, if conditions are good a lot can be achieved, but as was the case on this voyage bad weather prevailed and very little was accomplished. 
 
 As no aerial photography was attempt the video drift sight attachment made for the aerial camera system could not be tested and therefore no recommendations about its suitability for use in camera system can be made.
