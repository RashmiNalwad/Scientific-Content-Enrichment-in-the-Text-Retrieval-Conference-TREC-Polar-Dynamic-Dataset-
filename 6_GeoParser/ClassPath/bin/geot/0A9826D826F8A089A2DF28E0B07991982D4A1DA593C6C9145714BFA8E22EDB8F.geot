        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            This data is an optimal Northern Hemisphere mean surface temperature 
 reconstruction from terrestrial borehole temperature profiles spanning 
 the past five centuries. The pattern of borehole ground surface 
 temperature (GST) reconstructions displays prominent discrepancies 
 with instrumental surface air temperature (SAT) estimates during the 
 20th century, suggesting the presence of a considerable  ... amount of 
 noise and/or bias in any underlying spatial SAT signal. The vast 
 majority of variance in the borehole dataset is efficiently retained 
 by its two leading eigenvectors. A sizable share of the variance in 
 the first eigenvector appears to be associated with non-SAT related 
 bias in the borehole data. A weak but detectable SAT signal appears to 
 be described by a combination of the first two 
 eigenvectors. Exploiting this eigendecomposition, application of 
 optimal signal estimation methods yields a hemispheric borehole SAT 
 reconstruction that is largely consistent with instrumental data 
 available in past centuries, and is indistinguishable in its major 
 features from several published long-term temperature estimates based 
 on both climate proxy data and model simulations.
