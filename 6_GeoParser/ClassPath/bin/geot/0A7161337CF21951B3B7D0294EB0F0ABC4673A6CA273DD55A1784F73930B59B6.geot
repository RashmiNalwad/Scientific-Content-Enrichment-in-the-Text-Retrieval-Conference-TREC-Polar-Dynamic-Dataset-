                            The LBA / South American Data Collection is a group of datasets which 
 support the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia 
 (LBA) and other studies of South American extent. Example datasets 
 include NDVI, Land Cover, and Soils. The spatial resolution and time 
 periods covered vary by dataset, and the data come from multiple 
 sources. Please refer to Table 1 for specifics of the current Datasets 
 & Variables within this Collection. Additional information is provided 
 within the dataset and variable notes when using the EOS-WEBSTER 
 Search & Retrieve tool.
