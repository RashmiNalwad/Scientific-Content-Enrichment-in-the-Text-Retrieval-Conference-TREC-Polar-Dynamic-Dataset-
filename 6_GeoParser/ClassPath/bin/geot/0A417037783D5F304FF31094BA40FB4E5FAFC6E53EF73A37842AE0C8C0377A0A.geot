                    Project Description

                    
                        
                            The World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) was a component of the 

 World Climate Research Program (WCRP) and remains the most ambitious 

 oceanographic experiment undertaken to-date. 

 

 In addition to global observations furnished by satellites, 

 conventional in-situ physical and chemical observations were made by 

 nearly 30 nations in 4 of the worlds oceans. At the same time global 

 numerical ocean models were developed to assimilate these 

 measurements. This activity continues (2003). 

 

 The field phase of the project lasted from 1990-1998 and was followed 

 by Analysis, Interpretation, Modelling and Synthesis activities. This, 

 the AIMS phase of WOCE, officially continued to the end of 2002 with 

 the tasks to be undertaken described in the WOCE AIMS Strategy 

 document. 

 

 The success of WOCE AIMS will have considerable impact on follow on 

 programmes;- CLIVAR, a global study of ocean climate variability and 

 predictability, GODAE, the Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment, 

 ARGO a global array of temperature/salinity profiling floats.
