        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The Transantarctic Mountains (TAM) represents the uplifted rift flank that 
 defines the geological and morphological boundary between East and West 
 Antarctica. The southernmost large outlet glacier through the TAM is the 
 seldom-visited Reedy Glacier. The Ford Nunataks are situated within the 
 Transantarctic Mountain Front (TMF) on the eastern side of the Reedy Glacier 
  ... lying between the dramatic escarpment (~2500 m relief) of the Wisconsin Range 
 and the down-dropped basins of the West Antarctic Rift System (WARS). 
 
 This work represents part of a series of studies along the TAM documenting the 
 denudation history in order to constrain the tectonic evolution of the TAM and 
 WARS. This data set comprises low temperature thermochronology data from the 
 Transantarctic Mountains. Specifically, apatite fission track ages and track 
 length information from samples collected at a number of localities along the 
 Transantarctic Mountains.
