                            Abstract: 
                            The Australian Antarctic Division carried out a traverse from Davis station in the spring of 1970, following the "SG" line of stakes. A daily log of weather observations was kept during the traverse, recording air temperature, wind speed and direction, cloud cover, visibility, and other remarks on the conditions. 
 
 Records for this work have been archived at the Australian Antarctic Division.
