	Description:
	
                  	Abstract:
	
                        
                        Velocities for the Pine Island Glacier are derived using correlation analysis, using the IMCORR software package (Scambos
                        and others, 1992) modified as discussed in Warner and Roberts (2013), applied to Landsat 7 ETM+ band 8 images for Path 233,
                        Row 113,(15 m x 15 m pixels). Images are "Systematic Terrain Correction" (Level 1GT) products from the United States Geological
                        Survey. A subset of these velocities was presented, and their significance discussed, in Warner and Roberts (2013).
                        
                        The velocities are presented in standard Polar Stereographic projection with a reference latitude of 71 south (PS71). 
                        
                        Parameters for the correlation analysis are a reference window of 64 x 64 pixels and a search window of 512 x 512 pixels.
                        Displacements were measured with a 50 % overlap of reference windows. Velocities are binned onto a 1km x 1km grid using trimmed
                        least squares. 
                        
                        Velocities are given for the epochs 
                        13-Jan-2001 to 16-Nov-2002 
                        16-Nov-2002 to 24-Jan-2005 
                        24-Jan-2005 to 14-Jan-2007 
                        14-Jan-2007 to 3-Nov-2009 
                        3-Nov-2009 to 10-Feb-2011 
                        
                        Data for each epoch is presented in individual space-delimited text files, with the four columns being the Easting Position
                        (PS71) of the centre of the 1km x 1km grid box in metres, Northing Position (PS71) of the centre of the 1km x 1km grid box
                        in metres, Easting component of surface velocity in metres per year, Northing component of surface velocity in metres per
                        year at the cell centre location. 
                        
                        - Easting (metres) 
                        - Northing (metres) 
                        - Easting velocity component  (metres per year) 
                        - Northing velocity component (metres per year)
