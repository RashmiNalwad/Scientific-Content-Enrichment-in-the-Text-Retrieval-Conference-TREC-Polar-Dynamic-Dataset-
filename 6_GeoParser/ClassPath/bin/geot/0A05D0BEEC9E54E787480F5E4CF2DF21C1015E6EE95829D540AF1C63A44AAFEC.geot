        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) seeks to understand 
 the processes that control the transfer of carbon and other 
 biologically active elements in the ocean. In addition, JGOFS 
 hopes to improve global-scale predictions of the ocean's response to 
 human-induced climate change. 
 
 The North Atlantic Bloom Experiment (NABE)  ... was a multidisciplinary, 
 multinational pilot study of JGOFS, studying the spring phytoplankton 
 bloom in the North Atlantic and its associated biogeochemical 
 processes. It took place from April until July, 1989, on two cruises 
 of the RV Atlantis II and one cruise of the RV Endeavor. The stations 
 in the North Atlantic were located from 18N to 72N and from 8W to 47W. 
 
 At several stations, mesozooplankton were sampled and divided into the 
 following size fractions: 0.2-0.5 mm, 0.5-1.0 mm, and 1.0-2.0 mm. 
 Carbon ingestion rates for each size fraction per station 
 were determined. Values are given in mgC ingested/ (mg body C)hr.
