The topic of climate change inspires a lot of debate. At NASA, it has also inspired a lot of science.

NASA scientists examine the Earth’s climate and how it is changing – gaining knowledge (or insight?) through decades of satellite observations, powerful computer models and expert scientific analysis.

Over the course of this month, these NASA climate experts will answer selected questions through the agency’s social media channels – primarily on YouTube, Twitter and Google+.

But first – we need your questions.

Have a question that’s always confounded you about Earth’s climate? Wonder why it matters that the climate is changing now if it has changed before? Or how scientists know changes seen in recent decades are the result of human activities, not natural causes?

Go ahead. Ask a climate scientist.

Here’s how you can take part:

YouTube

NASA scientists will be recording video responses to some of the questions we receive. The responses will be posted to the NASAExplorer YouTube channel.

To submit a question, record a short, 10-15 second video with your question and upload it to YouTube – and be sure to tag the video “#askclimate” so that we can find it. You can also simply post a question on Twitter with the same hashtag, “#askclimate.”

Twitter

NASA scientists will directly answer questions in three separate Twitter chats, covering key climate topics. Again, all these chats will use the hashtag “#askclimate.” You can join in on these dates and at these accounts:

Wed., Sept. 4, 2 p.m. EDT

@NASA_ICE

Wed., Sept. 11, 2 p.m. EDT

@EarthVitalSigns

Google+ Hangouts

On Sept. 27, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will release the Summary For Policymakers of its Fifth Assessment Report. This plain-language document, intended for the public, lays out what is a consensus understanding by the scientific community of the state of climate change science.

On Mon., Sept. 30, NASA will host two Google+ Hangouts – one in English, one with Spanish-speaking scientists – to continue the discussion about climate science and answer questions about the IPCC report.

Watch for announcements via NASA’s Google+ and our other social media accounts about the specific times and details for these events.

		Was it the extended solar minimum whereat one of the 16 coronal magnetic segments was blown apart by a CME, which caused the excess of direct solar radiation to warm up Earth’s atmospheres, specifically by reflections from the methosphere’s polar toroid clouds when that polar axis is tilted away from solar rays?
