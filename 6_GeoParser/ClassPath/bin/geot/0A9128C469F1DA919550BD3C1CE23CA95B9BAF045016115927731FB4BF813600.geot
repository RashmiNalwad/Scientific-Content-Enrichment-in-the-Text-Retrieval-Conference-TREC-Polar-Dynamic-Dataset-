                            Abstract: 
                            The "National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program, Version 2 
 (NAPAP)" was initiated under the Acid Precipitation Act of 1980 
 to study the causes and potential effects of acid deposition in 
 and around the United States. A fundamental objective of the 
 NAPAP research program was to investigate emissions sources that 
 may contribute to acid deposition. To achieve this role, a 
 NAPAP Task Group on Emissions and Controls developed historical 
 and current (1985) inventories of acid deposition precursor 
 emissions.
