        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            This dataset consists of: (1) a suite of crystalline rocks (primarily granitoids & quartzites, with subordinate gneisses, schists, volcanic rocks, and mafic intrusive rocks) collected from the Antarctic Peninsula and adjacent islands, and (2) geochronology and geochemistry data from some of the aforementioned samples. 
 
 The collection and analysis of samples in this growing database were funded by  ... NSF awards to David Barbeau at the University of South Carolina (IPY/ANT-0732995 on Drake Passage opening; and EAGER/ANT-1241460 on the purported Cretaceous glaciation of Antarctica), and to Sidney Hemming at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University (EAGER/ANT-1241574 on the purported Cretaceous glaciation of Antarctica). 
 
 A metadata file detailing the samples collected and analyzed as part of the collection of this sample and data suite can be found through SESAR at the URL listed in this AMD entry. The associated SESAR metadata file will remain Private until September 2015 to facilitate publication of results. However, any investigators interested in access to, details about, or the status of various samples should contact the PI (David Barbeau, at the Tectonics and Sedimentation Laboratory of the University of South Carolina) in advance of that date if necessary. 
 
 Many of the samples and unpublished data in this dataset are being used for a subsequent NSF-funded project, thus access to and use of the samples may be limited through 2015. 
    
                        

                    
                    
                        
                            

                            Purpose: 
                            These samples and resulting data were collected to assess (1) the exhumation history of the Antarctic Peninsula, (2) the composition & provenance of possible metasedimentary and igneous sediment sources for the Cretaceous-Cenozoic Larsen basin, and (3) the geochronology of the Antarctic Peninsula. 
 
 These efforts are/were primarily undertaken to understand (1) the history of opening of Drake Passage between the Antarctic Peninsula and southernmost South America, and (2) assessment of the purported Cretaceous glaciation of Antarctica.

        Quality
        
            The quality of geochronology and geochemistry data is variable depending largely upon sample quality, but is generally within the standards required for publication in scientific journals in the first decade of the 21st century. 
        
    




            
            







    
        Access Constraints
        
            Access to and use of samples is dependent upon the state of ongoing projects at the University of South Carolina. Contact PI (David Barbeau) for any sample usage requests. 
 
 Use of acquired and published geochronology and geochemistry data is unconstrained. 
 
 Access to and use of unpublished geochronology and geochemistry data is dependent upon the state of ongoing projects at the University of South Carolina. Contact PI (David Barbeau) with any requests or inquiries about existing unpublished data. 
        
    




            
            







    
    
    Use Constraints
    
        Use of acquired and published geochronology and geochemistry data is unconstrained, pending acknowledgement of the Tectonics and Sedimentation Laboratory at the University of South Carolina and citation of peer-reviewed publications in which the data was originally published. 
 
 Access to and use of unpublished geochronology and geochemistry data is dependent upon the state of ongoing projects at the University of South Carolina. Contact PI (David Barbeau) with any requests or inquiries about existing unpublished data.
