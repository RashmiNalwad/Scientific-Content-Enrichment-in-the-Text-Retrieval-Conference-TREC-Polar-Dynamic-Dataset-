                Definition:

                
                    Transformation/Conversion services are defined as Data Handling Services that, in the case of transformation, apply an adjustment function to the original data that alters the absolute values of the data (e.g., interpolation, standardization, anomalies). In the case of conversion, the service is designed to apply a function to the data that transforms the relative value of the data but not the absolute (i.e., unit conversions).
 EXAMPLES: Anomalies (Transformation). Fahrenheit to Celsius (Conversion).
