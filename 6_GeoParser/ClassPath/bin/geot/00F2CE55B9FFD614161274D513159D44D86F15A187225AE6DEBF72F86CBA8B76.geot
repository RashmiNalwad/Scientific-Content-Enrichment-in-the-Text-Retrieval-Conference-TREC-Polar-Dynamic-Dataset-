                            Abstract: 
                            The LTOP monitoring in the Gulf of Alaska completed 4 years of sampling nutrients via cruises using the Alpha Helix. Sampling on all cruises included occupying stations along the Seward Line, which extends from the inner shelf to the edge of the continental slope. At each station Niskin bottle casts were used to collect water samples for nutrient analyses.

        Quality
        
            These data should be considered raw/unedited and have not had post-cruise calibrations applied. The data are poor until the net gets into the water. 
        
    




            
            









            
            







    
    
    Use Constraints
    
        Any person making substantial use of a data set must communicate with the investigators who acquired the data prior to publication and anticipate that the data collectors will be co-authors of published results. This extends to model results and to data organized for retrospective studies.
