                            Abstract: 
                            This data set contains radar echograms taken from the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS) ultra Multichannel Coherent Radar Depth Sounder (MCoRDS) over land and sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic. The data were collected as part of Operation IceBridge funded aircraft survey campaigns.

        Quality
        
            The high altitude data are generally lower quality than the low altitude data. This is because: 1. The cross-track antenna resolution is proportional to range creating severe layover problems in mountainous terrain. 2. The sidelobes from the 30 microsecond pulse duration mask out some of the returns that otherwise would have had a high enough signal to noise ratio. 3. The range to target is greater so the spherical spreading power loss is greater leading to a lower signal to noise ratio.
