        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) operates at 5 different channels simultaneously in the visible and infrared bands, with wavelengths specified in the instrument channels description. Channel 3 switches between 3a and 3b for daytime and nighttime. As a high-resolution imager (about 1.1 km near nadir) its main purpose is to provide cloud and surface information such as cloud coverage, cloud top temperature, surface temperature over land and sea, and vegetation or snow/ice. In addition, AVHRR products serve as input for the level 2 processing of IASI and ATOVS. The global products from AVHRR on NOAA satellites are only available at Global Area Coverage (GAC) spatial sampling, namely 5.4 km across track x 3.2 km along track at nadir.
