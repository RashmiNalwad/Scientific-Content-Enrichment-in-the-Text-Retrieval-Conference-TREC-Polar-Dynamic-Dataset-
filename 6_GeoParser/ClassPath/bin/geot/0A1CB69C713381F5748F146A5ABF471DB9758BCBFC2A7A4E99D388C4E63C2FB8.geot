                            Abstract: 
                            Four times daily global forcing fields from the US Navy NOGAPS model on 720X360 (averaged resolution of 0.5 degree) Gaussian computational grids. 
 
 Notice: These are Gaussian grids, not evenly spaced rectangular grids. If you need rectangular grids, use the standard 360X181 (standard 1 degree NOGAPS products).
