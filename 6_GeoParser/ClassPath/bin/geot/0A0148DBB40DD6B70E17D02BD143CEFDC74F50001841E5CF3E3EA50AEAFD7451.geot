    Summary

    
    

    
    	

    
        
            Abstract: 
            The Antarctic Marine Geology Research Facility Core and Sample Database
      contains basic descriptive information about deep-sea cores and samples
      collected by USAP investigators since the early 1960s. For the on-line version
      of the database, the basic (searchable) descriptive information for deep-sea
      cores includes Ship Name, Cruise Identifier, Core Identifier, Latitude,
      Longitude, Core Length and Water Depth.  Basic (searchable) descriptive
      information about samples obtained from the cores includes that identified
      above for the deep-sea core database plus fields for Investigator, Institution,
      Date Sample Acquired, and Comments.  All data is available in text or html
      formats.  The database contains searchable fields for core descriptions and
      bibliographic references to research conducted on the cores.
      
      Core and Sample data are available for the following research programs:
      1) Coring Cruises:
      USNS Eltanin /ARA Islas Orcadas Circumpolar Surveys
      Deep Freeze (USCGC Glacier ) cruises 76, 78-83, 85-87
      International Weddell Sea Oceanographic Expeditions (IWSOE)
      R/V Polar Duke cruises 86, 88-93, 95
      R/V Nathaniel B. Palmer cruises 93-
      R/V Laurence M. Gould cruises 98-
      USCG icebreakers Northwind, Eastwind and Edisto Kara Sea cruises
      Miscellaneous Anton Brun, Hero, Vema, and Robert Conrad cruises.
      
      2) Land and Ice-based Drilling Projects:
      Dry Valley Drilling Project (DVDP)
      Eastern Taylor Valley (ETV) Project
      Ross Ice Shelf Project (RISP)
      Cenozoic Investigations of the western Ross Sea (CIROS 1 & 2)
      Mt. Feather Project
      Cape Roberts Project (CRP) 1-3
