                            Abstract: 
                            This data set contains climatological monthly means of heat fluxes and 
 radiation budget over the global oceans, based on analyses of the 
 Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS) for the period 
 1950 - 1979. All data are given on a 2 x 2 latitude/longitude 
 grid. Meteorological and oceanographic parameters contained in 
 this data set include air temperature, mixed layer temperature, 
  ... precipitation, relative humidity, cloud cover, wind speed, sea 
 level pressure, salinity, absorbed solar radiation, outgoing 
 longwave radiation, net radiation, latent heat flux, sensible 
 heat flux, net downward heat flux, net freshwater flux, buoyancy 
 flux, frictional velocity, newtonian cooling rate, and transfer 
 coefficient for latent heat. Precipitation data were prepared 
 by Dennis Shea (NCAR). It was derived from land or island station 
 records and completed by satellite observations. Salinity data 
 required to compute buoyancy fluxes were taken from Sydney Levitus 
 (NOAA/NODC). All input data were monthly mean climatological 
 values except the surface salinity. 
 Because of the small variation of the climatological mean surface 
 salinity throughout the year, annual mean values were used.
