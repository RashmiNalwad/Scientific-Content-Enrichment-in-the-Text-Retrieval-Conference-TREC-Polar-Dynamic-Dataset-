		Last DIF Revision Date


		
    

		Definition
	The <Last_DIF_Revision_Date> specifies the date the metadata record was created.  The <Last_DIF_Revision_Date> is automatically populated by the authoring tools with the date the metadata  entry was created or modified, however, the author may change the date.

	 
	Syntax
	<Last_DIF_Revision_Date>yyyy-mm-dd</Last_DIF_Revision_Date > 

              

              Year, month and day must follow the International  Standard ISO 8601 in the form: yyyy-mm-dd, where:

          
            

              yyyy= the 4 digit year

              mm= the 2-digit month (01 – 12)

              dd = the 2-digit day (01-31)

          

	 
	Usage
		The <Last_DIF_Revision_Date> is recommended  and may not be repeated.


	 
	Example
	<Last_DIF_Revision_Date>2006-11-01</Last_DIF_Revision_Date>
