Whats the status of this?

The block on the IP should be removed later today.
We are not modifying any rules and if the behavior 
that resulted in the block appears again, the IPs will 
be blocked again.Â  If you're curious as to what that 
behavior was - might have been related to over 10,000
file_search requests a day for over two weeks...

Thanks for the update. 
That must have been a hung process or something. I've run this script for a long time without any problems
I'll pay attention to it and verify things are running as intended.
Thanks

appears my IP is blocked again. Can you assist again? 
My IPs are: 
75.126.153.155
66.85.155.210

I have a script that runs every 3 minutes, is that too frequent?

Neither of those IPs has a block on our firewalls.

Hi Sean, thanks for your assistance. I get the following results from my 66.85.155.210 box.
This script works from other boxes.

Chris,

The ip, 75.126.153.155 is not on any of our block lists. Are you still unable to connect to oceandata or samoa?

Ah, I just realized the IP I gave you is incorrect. My outgoing IP is: 74.86.100.66

And yes, I am still unable to reach the http://oceandata.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov. Apologies for the mistake.

Thanks for your help.
Chris
