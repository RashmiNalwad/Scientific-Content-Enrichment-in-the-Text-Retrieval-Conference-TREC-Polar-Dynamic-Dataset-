                            L3B, Level 3 Binned data generates bin data (temporarily and spatially sampled) from level 2 data. Storing supplemental information such as 3 kinds of bin information, physical quantity of sea surface temperature (SST), scene information and others, the product is monthly integrated.GAC : Global Area Coverage, data are divided into tilt segment
