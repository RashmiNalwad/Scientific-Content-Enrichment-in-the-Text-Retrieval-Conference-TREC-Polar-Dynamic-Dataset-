                  The MODIS instrument is operating
                    on both the Terra and Aqua spacecraft.  It  has a viewing swath width of 2,330
                    km and views the  entire surface of the Earth every one to
                    two days. Its detectors  measure 36 spectral bands between
                    0.405 and 14.385 µm, 
                    and it acquires data at three spatial resolutions -- 250m,
                     500m, and 1,000m.

                  Along with all the data from other instruments on board
                    the  Terra spacecraft and Aqua Spacecraft, MODIS data are
                    transferred to ground stations in White Sands, New Mexico,
                    via the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS).
                    The data are then sent to the EOS Data and Operations System
                    (EDOS) at the Goddard Space Flight Center. The Level 1A, Level 1B, geolocation and cloud mask products and the Higher-level MODIS land and atmosphere products are produced
                    by the MODIS Adaptive Processing System (MODAPS), and then
                    are parceled out among three DAACs for distribution. Ocean
                    color products are produced by the Ocean Color Data Processing
                    System (OCDPS) and distributed to the science and applications
                    community.

                    

                    The many data products derived from MODIS observations describe
                    features of the land, oceans and the atmosphere that can
                    be used for studies of processes and trends on local to global
                    scales.   As just noted, MODIS products are available
                    from several sources.  MODIS Level 1 and atmosphere
                    products are available through the the LAADS web.  Land Products
                    are available through the Land Processes DAAC at the U. S.
                    Geological Survey EROS Data Center (EDC).  Cryosphere
                    data products (snow and sea ice cover) are available from
                    the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Boulder,
                    Colorado.  Ocean color products and sea surface temperature
                    products along with information about these products are
                    obtainable at the OCDPS at GSFC.   Users with an appropriate
                    x-band receiving system may capture regional data directly
                    from the spacecraft using the MODIS Direct Broadcast signal.

                    information about obtaining MODIS data can be found from
