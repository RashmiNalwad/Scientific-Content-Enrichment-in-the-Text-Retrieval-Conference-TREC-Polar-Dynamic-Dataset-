        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Metadata Access Tool for Climate and Health (MATCH) is a searchable clearinghouse of publicly available Federal metadata (i.e. data about data) and links to datasets. Most metadata on MATCH pertain to geospatial data sets ranging from local to global scales. 
 
 MATCH is a project of the Interagency Cross-Cutting Group on Climate Change and Human Health (CCHHG) of the U.S. Global Change Research  ... Program (USGCRP). The CCHHG is charged with planning, coordinating, implementing, evaluating, and reporting on Federal research on the impacts of global climate change on human health in order to build more resilient communities. Technical support for MATCH is provided primarily by the CCHHG Data Integration (DI) workstream and its interagency members. 
 
 The goals of MATCH are to: 
 
 1. Provide an easily accessible clearinghouse of relevant Federal metadata on climate and health that will increase efficiency in solving research problems. 
 
 2. Promote application of research and information to understand, mitigate, and adapt to the health effects of climate change. 
 
 3. Facilitate multidirectional communication among interested stakeholders to inform and shape Federal research directions. 
 
 4. Encourage collaboration among traditional and non-traditional partners in development of new initiatives to address emerging climate and health issues. 
 
 MATCH resources are identified, collected, and disseminated by the DI workstream using an XML-based geoportal tool that is open-source and web 2.0 compliant. Currently, only publicly available Federal metadata is included in MATCH, although users may eventually be able to suggest or upload metadata that meet certain criteria. However, inclusion of a resource or the metadata it contains does not imply any endorsement or guarantee of its quality or completeness by the USGCRP or any of its member agencies.
