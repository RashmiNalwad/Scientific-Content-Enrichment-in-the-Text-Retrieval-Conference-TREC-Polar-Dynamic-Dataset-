        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Community Analysis Program (CAP) searches for structure in ecological community 
 data. It is easy to use, affordable, with quality output. It offers analytical 
 techniques commonly used by community ecologists, and researchers in other 
 fields such as palaeontology, archaeology and the social sciences. Programs 
 using these techniques have long been available, but they are often difficult 
 to use since  ... they were written for mainframe computers or PCs using DOS, often 
 with little or no graphical output. In CAP, data can be organised using 
 standard programs such as Excel, and the output is displayed, exported and 
 printed using standard Windows techniques. It is particularly useful for 
 ecological teaching because it allows students to quickly enter data, try 
 different transformations, and explore a wide range of methods within a 
 familiar Windows setting. 
 
 Version 2.0, released 14/5/02, includes: Maximum size of data set increased 
 from 500 samples x 500 species to 1000 x 1000 - even for TWINSPAN and DECORANA 
 calculations. Improved chart editing and labelling functions; graphs can be 
 exported in .BMP, .EMF, .JPEG, .PCX and .PNG file formats, and data series as 
 plain text, XML, HTML tables or Excel format. Automatically checks for, and 
 removes, blank cells and zero-sum rows on opening a data set. Rows or columns 
 can be deselected, allowing you to work with only part of the data set. Help 
 system and manual completely revised, now include a Worked Example. New 
 ordination method, Species Filtering, has been added.
