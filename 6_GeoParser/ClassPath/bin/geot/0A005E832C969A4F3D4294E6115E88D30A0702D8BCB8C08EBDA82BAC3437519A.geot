        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Characteristics and compilation of the meteorological data obtained from King Sejong Station, Antarctica     
                        

                    
                    
                        
                            

                            Purpose: 
                            Meteorological observation at King Sejong Station was carried out from February in 1988. Since then, some meteorological data reports which are observed and analyzed at the Station are published through an annual report. Those reports, however, are so fragmentary as to not represent and/or understand annual data simultaneously. Therefore, goals of this study are to arrange those scraps systematically, and to understand characteristics of meteorological phenomena at the Station.
