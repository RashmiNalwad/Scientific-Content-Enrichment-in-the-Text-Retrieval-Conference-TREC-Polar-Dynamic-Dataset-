          Data description
        

        
        
          The Antarctic polar vortex acts as a barrier to the exchange of
          polar and midlatitude air. The potential vorticity (PV) is a
          conserved quantity that acts as a tracer for motion on an
          isentropic surface. Plotting contours of PV on an isentropic
          surface readily shows the extent of the polar vortex. In the
          Antarctic winter, the PV is more negative going from midlatitudes
          to the pole. The spacing of PV contours is very wide in the
          midlatitudes, very tight at the polar vortex edge, and then widens
          again inside of the vortex. The edge of the vortex is defined to
          be where the contours of PV are closest together. The area inside
          of this edge can be determined as the area of the polar vortex. 
        

        
        
          A useful quantity in analyzing PV and vortex behavior is the
          equivalent latitude. Since PV tends to decrease from the equator
          to the South Pole, we calculate the area under successive PV
          contours. The areas are rearranged so that they vary from 1 at the
          equator to 0 at the pole. The transformed contours of PV can be
          thought of as being symmetrically arranged around the pole and
          monotonically decreasing from the equator to the pole. The
          latitudes on this transformed map projection are called equivalent
          latitudes. Plotting PV vs. equivalent latitude shows an
          interesting shape: an “S” curve, where the upswing
          area of the “S” is located at the vortex edge. Finding
          the maximum in the first derivative of PV with respect to
          equivalent latitude determines the vortex edge.

          is a NASA reanalysis for the satellite era using a major new
          version of the Goddard Earth Observing System Data Assimilation
          System Version 5 (GEOS-5). The project focuses on historical
          analyses of the hydrological cycle in a broad range of weather and
          climate time scales. It places modern observing systems (such as

          suite of observations in a climate
          context. Since these data are from a reanalysis, they are not
          up-to-date. So, we supplement with the 
          
            GEOS-5 FP
          
          data that are also produced by the
          
            GEOS-5
          
          model in near real time. These products are produced by the NASA 
          
            Global Modeling and Assimilation Office
          
          (GMAO).
