                            Abstract: 
                            The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has developed a companion software tool to HAZUS-MH called the HAZUS-MH Risk Assessment Tool (RAT) to help you produce your risk assessment outputs for earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes. This tool was developed as a third-party model to support HAZUS-MH and is used to display the outputs from the HAZUS-MH risk assessment in an easy-to-use format. The RAT pulls natural hazard data, inventory data, and loss estimate data into pre-formatted summary tables and text. These summaries can support the presentation of data to decision-makers and other stakeholders and in your mitigation plan.
