                            Abstract: 
                            Gulfwatch is presently a program in which the blue mussel, Mytilus 
 edulis, is used as an indicator for habitat exposure to organic and inorganic 
 contaminants. Bivalves, such as M. edulis, have been successfully used as 
 indicator organisms in environmental monitoring programs throughout the world 
 to identify variation in chemical contaminants between sites, and contribute to 
 the understanding of trends in coastal contamination.
