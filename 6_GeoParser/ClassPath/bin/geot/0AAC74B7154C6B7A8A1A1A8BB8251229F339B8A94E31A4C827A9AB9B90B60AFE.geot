    Summary

    
    

    
    	

    
        
            Abstract: 
            The World Health Organization's Department of Emergency and Humanitarian Action
Web site provides up-to-date details about ongoing health crises around the
world, as well as articles from its EHA Highlights newsletter. The department
also maintains the "Health Intelligence Network for Advanced Planning" (HINAP)
on this site. HINAP consolidates baseline health information for selected
countries, identifies health issues of primary concern, and makes this
information available for program planning. Up-to-date information is provided
during an emergency, permitting program adjustment due to changing
circumstances, thereby minimizing mortality and morbidity from preventable
causes.

Description: 

The World Health Organization, the United Nations specialized agency for
 health, was established on 7 April 1948. WHO's objective, as set out in its
 Constitution, is the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of
 health. Health is defined in WHO's Constitution as a state of complete
 physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or
 infirmity.
 
 WHO is governed by 192 Member States through the World Health Assembly. The
 Health Assembly is composed of representatives from WHO's Member States. The
 main tasks of the World Health Assembly are to approve the WHO programme and
 the budget for the following biennium and to decide major policy questions.
