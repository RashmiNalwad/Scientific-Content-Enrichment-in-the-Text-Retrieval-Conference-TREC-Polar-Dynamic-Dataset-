                            Abstract: 
                            The Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) 
 Data Base at NCAR/HAO holds data collected from the IR Michelson 
 Interferometer located in Stockholm Sweden. The interferometer 
 measured neutral temperatures around 86 km derived from nightglow 
 hydroxyl (OH) measurements. The interferometer has been in operation 
 since 1991. The Stockholm IR Michelson Interferometer is  ... operated by 
 the Utah State University and the Meteorological Institute of 
 Stockholm University with support from the NSF and the University of 
 Stockholm. 
 
 The CEDAR Data Base is accessible through the WWW and ftp, but users 
 must have a valid access form, available from the WWW or ftp (see 
 Access and Use constraints) or contact Barbara Emery 
 (emery@hao.ucar.edu). See the WWW site for additonal information on 
 accessing the data and Rules of the Road procedures.
