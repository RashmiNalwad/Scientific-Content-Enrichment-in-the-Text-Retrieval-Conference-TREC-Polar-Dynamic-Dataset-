        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The Global Emissions Inventory Activity (GEIA) is an activity of the 
 International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Core Project of the 
 International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP). The focus of GEIA 
 is to make global emissions available on a one degree grid. 
 
 A time-averaged inventory of subaerial volcanic sulfur emissions is 
 presented primarily for the use of global sulfur and sulfate  ... modelers. 
 This inventory is based upon the 25 year history of making sulfur, 
 primarily sulfur dioxide, measurements at volcanoes. These "hard" 
 data are then extrapolated to other volcanoes. Actual measurements of 
 subaerial volcanic SO2 emissions indicate a time-averaged flux of 13 
 Tg/a SO2 based upon an early 1970's to 1997 time frame. When 
 considering the other sulfur species also present in volcanic 
 emissions, a time-averaged inventory of subaerial volcanic sulfur 
 emissions is 10 Tg/a S. 
 
 The GEIA repository for this inventory contains nine files. The file, 
 volcanos.txt, is a copy of the inventory description. Volcano 
 altitudes are in volcalt.txt and the references used to construct the 
 inventory in bibliography.txt. Volcano locations are stored in 
 LOCavg1.1a and plotted in LOCavg1.ps. SO2 from continuously emitting 
 volcanoes are stored in COVavg1.1a and plotted in COVavg1.ps. SO2 
 from sporadically emitting volcanoes are stored in SPVmax1.1a and 
 plotted in SPVmax1.ps.
