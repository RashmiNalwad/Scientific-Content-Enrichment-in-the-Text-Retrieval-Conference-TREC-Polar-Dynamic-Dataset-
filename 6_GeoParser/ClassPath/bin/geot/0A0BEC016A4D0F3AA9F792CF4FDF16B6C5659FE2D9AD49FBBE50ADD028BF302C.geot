                            Abstract: 
                            The antarctic Zhongshan weather station of China which was set up in Feb. 1989 locates in Larsmann hills, its station number is 89573. The antarctic Zhongshan weather station collects observation data four times a day (Beijing time 02, 08, 14, 20), and it records the change of the weather at any moment. Its observation items includes clouds, visibility, weather phenomenon, wind direction, wind speed, temperature, humidity, air pressure, sunlight, soil temperature, precipitation etc. And now, it also observes atmospheric ozone amount and makes site weather forecast for science research.
