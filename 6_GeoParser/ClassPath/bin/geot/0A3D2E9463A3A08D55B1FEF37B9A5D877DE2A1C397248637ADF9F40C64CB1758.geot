        Quality
        
            The image processing was undertaken using the ERDAS Imagine software. The Quickbird Images processed are 03FEB04044707-M2AS-000000053022_01_P001 and 03FEB04044707-P2AS-000000053022_01_P001. In 2000 Dr Jenny Scott captured Control Points using a hand-held GPS. The image was georeferenced using 14 of these control points and then ortho-rectified using the DEM supplied by Radarsat in 1997. The  ... accuracy achieved is +/- 15m. The Multispectral image has a pixel resolution of +/-2.4m while the pan image has a resolution of +/-0.6m. These images were combined to produce a higher resolution colour image known as a pan sharpened image. To produce the pan sharpened image the following parameters were used: Method - Brovey Transform, Resampling Technique - Cubic Convolution, Data Type - Unsigned 16 bit. The pixel resolution of the image is 0.6m. The image was projected to UTM Zone 43 (WGS84). 
 
 NOTE: These images have been processed twice. The first time with satellite ephemeris data and ortho-rectified using the Radarsat DEM. The second time with Jenny Scott's control points and ortho-rectified using the Radarsat DEM. This metadata record refers to the second process. See metadata record id QUICKBIRD_LAURENS_ORPMS for the 1st.
