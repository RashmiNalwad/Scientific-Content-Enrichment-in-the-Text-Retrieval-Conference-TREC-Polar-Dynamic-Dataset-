        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The SPECMAP paleoclimate archives at NOAA/NCDC World Data Center for 
 Paleoclimatology consist of four (4) archives: 
 
 ARCHIVE 1 contains 101 SPECMAP files, including planktonic counts and 
 isotope values, age and sea surface temperature models, and SST 
 estimates. These data were compiled by J. Imbrie and A. Duffy at 
 Brown University for the SPECMAP project. This archive, prepared as 
 part of the  ... NSF-funded SPECMAP Project, contains climatic time series 
 of the past 400,000 years, as well as basic downcore and core-top data 
 from which these time series are derived. 
 
 The O-18 chronologies of Imbrie et al. (1984) and Martinson et al. 
 (1987) are given for reference, as well as orbital time series taken 
 from the work of Berger (1978a,b). 
 
 Also archived are N. G. Kipp's Atlantic core-top foraminiferal data 
 and SST equations FA20 and UW7 derived from them by procedures 
 described in Kipp (1976). FA20 is used to derive SST estimates for 
 cores V25-21, V30-49, V25-59, V25-56, V30-40, RC24-16, V22-174, and 
 RC12-294. Equation UW7, designed for upwelling areas in the southeast 
 Atlantic is used to estimate temperature variations in RC13-228. 
 
 Data and models archived here are the basis for the paleoclimatic time 
 series analyzed in 'Oceanic Response to Orbital Forcing in the Late 
 Quaternary: Observational and Experimental Strategies', by J. Imbrie, 
 A. McIntyre, and A. C. Mix. in 'Climate and Geosciences, A Challenge 
 for Science snd Society in the 21st Century', A. Berger, 
 S. H. Schneider, and J.-C. Duplessy, eds., D. Reidel Publishing 
 Company. Table 2 gives the parameters of time series analyzed in this 
 paper. 
 
 Parts of this archive are referenced in 'Surface water response of the 
 equatorial Atlantic Ocean to orbital forcing' by McIntyre et al., 
 1989, Paleoceanography, v. 4, p. 19-55. 
 
 Many of the data and models in this archive have been generated as 
 part of the SPECMAP project. Other data sources are listed in Table 1 
 in the printed memo which accompanies this archive. These include 
 unpublished data of T. J. Crowley, J. D. Hays, N. G. Kipp, 
 A. McIntyre, A. C. Mix, W. F. Ruddiman, and N. J. Shackleton. 
 For more information, see: 
 
 SPECMAP Archive #2 contains 70 files including planktonic counts and 
 isotope values, age and sea surface temperature models, and SST 
 estimates. These data were compiled by J. Imbrie et al, and published 
 as:'On the structure and origin of major glaciation cycles. 
 1. Linear responses to Milankovitch forcing' Paleoceanography, Dec, 
 1992 (Imbrie et al.,1992). 
 For more information, see: 
 
 SPECMAP Archive #3 contains 10 files represent analytical results and 
 data which formed the basis for the discussion of the Devils Hole 
 calcite record, DH-11, in the original reference: J. Imbrie, 
 A. C. Mix, and D. G. Martinson, 1993, Milankovitch Theory Viewed from 
 Devils Hole, NATURE, May, 1993. 
 For more information, see: 
 
 SPECMAP Archive #4 contains 47 files of the time series appearing in 
 'On the Structure and Origin of Major Glaciation Cycles: part 2', 
 Imbrie et al., PALEOCEANOGRAPHY, Dec., 1993 (hereafter part 2). If a 
 time series is contained in SPECMAP Archive 2 it is not repeated here.
