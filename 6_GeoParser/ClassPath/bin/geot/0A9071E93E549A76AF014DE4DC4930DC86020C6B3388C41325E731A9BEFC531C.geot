    Summary


    

    
    	

    
        
            Abstract: 
            Baseline chemistry data for ponds and lakes in the Victoria Valley/Bull Pass region was collected in January 1990.  Water samples were taken from Upper Victoria Glacier drainage, Lake Victoria, Lake Vida, Lower Victoria Glacier drainage and associated brine and meltwater pools, Lake Thomas, and ice covered pools at the entrance to the Barwick Valley, the top of Mt Insel and Bull Pass. Up to 3 litres of water was collected from each site and were analysed for pH, temperature, sulphide concentration, major ions, nutrients,  trace metals (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb,  Cd) and stable isotopes (D & O18). Evaporite salts from lake margins and meltpools were collected and identified by x-ray diffraction.
