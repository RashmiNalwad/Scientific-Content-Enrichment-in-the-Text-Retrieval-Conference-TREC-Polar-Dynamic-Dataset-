        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Two major traverse programs were run out of Casey in 1985 over the Law Dome and Wilkes Land area. The first (Autumn/Winter) traverse ran from the 24th of March to 14th of June. The second (Spring) traverse ran from the 10th of September to the 3rd of January. Both traverses covered similar areas, visiting the A0, GC and GD series of snow canes. 
 
 Numerous measurements were taken during the  ... traverses in various quantities, including snow accumulation, sastrugi observations, wind direction and speed, air temperature, barometric pressure, snow hardness, snow density, gravity, snow temperature, and stratigraphy and isotope observations from shallow drilled cores. 
 
 All log books from these traverses are archived at the Australian Antarctic Division. Scanned cover pages for each of the logbooks are available as a PDF download from this record.
