        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Photographs and other visual media provide valuable pre- and post-event data for natural hazards. Research, mitigation, and forecasting rely on visual data for post-analysis, inundation mapping and historic records. Instrumental data only reveal a portion of the whole story; photographs explicitly illustrate the physical and societal impacts from an event. 
 This resource provides high-resolution geologic and damage photographs from natural hazards events, including earthquakes, tsunamis, slides, volcanic eruptions and geologic movement (faults, creep, subsidence and flows). The earliest images date back to 1886. Each event also links to NGDC's Global Historical hazards databases, which provide details for these events.     
                        

                    
                    
                        
                            

                            Purpose: 
                            Make available damage images for research and education
