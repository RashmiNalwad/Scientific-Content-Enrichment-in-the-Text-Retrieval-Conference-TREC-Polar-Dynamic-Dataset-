                            Abstract: 
                            Carbon-14 data in this file were compiled by W.F. Ruddiman and 
 staff at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University. Data include 
 974 carbon-14 dates from 309 ocean sediment cores, covering the period from 40,000 
 years bp to the present worldwide. Estimated error range is given. Also included are 
 core identifier, latitude/longitude, water depth, depth in core,  ... institutional 
 source, laboratory number, and sediment fraction analyzed (total, bulk, or fine 
 fraction). The LDEO C14 data were originally submitted to NOAA's National Geophysical 
 Data Center (NGDC) for archive, but were subsequently transferred to NOAA's National 
 Climatic Data Center (NCDC) Paleoclimatology Group for stewardship. The data are available for direct download from NCDC's Web 
 server.
