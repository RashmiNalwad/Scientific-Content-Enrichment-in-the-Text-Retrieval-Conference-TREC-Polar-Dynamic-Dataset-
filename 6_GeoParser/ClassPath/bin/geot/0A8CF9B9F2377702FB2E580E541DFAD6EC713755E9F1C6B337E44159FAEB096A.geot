                            Abstract: 
                            Interactive Marine Observations: 
 
 The Tallahassee Office of the National Weather Service (NWS) makes 
 real-time marine weather observations accessible online for worldwide 
 ocean weather stations and buoys. 
 
 Marine weather measurements include air temperature, sea surface 
 temperature, surface winds, sea level pressure, pressure tendency, dew 
 point,  ... wave height, wave period, swell height, swell period, 
 significant wave height, relative wave steepness, and tide level. Not 
 all buoys report the same measurements, depending on the contributor 
 and data availability. The interface allows customized display of 
 units and timezones. 
 
 Currently, real-time data are contributed from the U.S. National Data 
 Buoy Center (NDBC), the U.S. Coast Guard, the United Kingdom, and 
 Canada. Over 300 stations are represented with more being added every 
 day.
