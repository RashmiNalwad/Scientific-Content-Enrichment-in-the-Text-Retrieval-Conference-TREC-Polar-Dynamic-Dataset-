        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            This work was completed as part of the SIPEX - Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem eXperiment - voyage. 
 
 Adapted from the SPIEX website: 
 
 During SIPEX we investigated the biogeochemistry of iron (Fe), including a comprehensive examination of its distribution, speciation (i.e. the different forms of Fe), cycling and its role in fuelling sea ice-based and pelagic algal communities. A major part of this  ... research concentrated on the influence of organic exopolysaccharides (EPS) on Fe solubility and its bio-availability. The distribution of other bioactive trace elements was also examined as a means of fingerprinting the source(s) of Fe, as well as indicating their biological requirements.

 Data on the small- to medium scale (0.1-1000 m) spatial and temporal distribution of Fe and EPS in sea ice cores, surface snow, brine and underlying seawater were determined in each sampled medium by the interdisciplinary team working on the SIPEX project (AAS 3026) in the East Antarctic sector in September/October 2007. Data include Chlorophyll a, salinity, temperature, sea-ice thickness, ice texture analysis, macro-nutrients (nitrate, phosphate, silicate), oxygen stable isotopes, POC and DOC, EPS, iron. 
 
 This work was completed as part of AAS (ASAC) project 3026.

        Quality
        
            A non-contaminating electro-polished stainless steel ice corer was used for sea ice sampling. Melted sea ice, snow, brine and seawater were then analysed to determine Fe and other trace metals of interest, including EPS concentrations, biological and physico-chemical parameters. The scientists wore clean suits to avoid contaminating the samples. 
 
 Additional work was carried out to determine Fe and Os isotopes in snow samples. Results will give insights on the contribution of extra-terrestrial dusts as a possible source of Fe to the ice cover.
