                    Project Description

                    
                        
                            
                            
                                 Vegetation regulates the flow of numerous biogeochemical cycles, most critically those of water, carbon, and nitrogen; it is also of great importance in local and global energy balances. Vegetation collections data include: 
 
 - Biomass 
 - Biome Characteristics 
 - Litter Chemistry and Decomposition 
 - Geoecology 
 - Nutrient Concentration, Profiles, and Turnover 
 - Global Fire Emissions, Vegetation, and Leaf Area Index (LAI) 
 - Ecosystem Structure and Function 
 - Phenoregions 
 - Carbon Flux
