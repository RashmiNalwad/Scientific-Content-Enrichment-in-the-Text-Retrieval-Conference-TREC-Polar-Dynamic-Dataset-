                            Abstract: 
                            The AMRC has collected synoptic weather observations (3 and 6 hourly) since January 1, 1997. These observations include a variety of information (temperature, dewpoint, barometeric pressure, wind speed and direction, etc.) from a variety of stations around the Antarctic and rim of the Southern Ocean (including manned stations, automatic weather stations, etc.)
