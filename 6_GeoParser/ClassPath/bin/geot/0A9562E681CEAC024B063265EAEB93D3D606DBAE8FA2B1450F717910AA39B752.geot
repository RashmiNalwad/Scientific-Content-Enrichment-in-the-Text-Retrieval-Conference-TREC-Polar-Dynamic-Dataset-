                            Abstract: 
                            The precipitation and frost data resides in 1 book, 'Atlas De 
 Finlande: Les Materiaux Meteorologiques et le Climat du Pays' (C/dab 
 J65mm) written in French. The data contained in this book are tables 
 maps, and graphs of monthly, seasonal, and annual precipitation 
 (especially thunderstorms), and frost data for Finland averaged over 
 the period 1886 to 1905. The parameters in tabular form include 
  ... annual number and days of thunderstorms by latitude and longitude 
 bands, and seasonal number of storms. There are maps of the annual 
 number of days of frost, and yearly precipitation. Graphs included in 
 these data are monthly and seasonal thunderstorms for hourly 
 intervals, and total monthly claps of thunder. The text of this book 
 may contain some useful data (not tabular, map, or graphic form) on 
 the surface parameters of temperature, wind, pressure, snow cover, 
 precipitation, and ice. 
 
 Snow and ice data resides in 2 books, 'Etat des Glaces et des Neiges 
 en Finland e Pendant L'Hiver' (C/dab AO e) written in French and some 
 German; and 'Schnee Und Eisverhaltnisse in Finland' (C/dab K84s) 
 written in German. The data contained in these books are tables and 
 maps of daily and annual snow, ice, and precipitation data for Finland 
 during the Winters 1892 to 1899. Parameters included in the tabular 
 data for ten-day periods are total snowfall; mean snowfall and snow 
 cover; mean number of snowfall, precipitation and snow cover days, and 
 snow depth. Other parameters included in the tables are: mean and 
 total daily snow amounts; total annual accumulation of snowfall; 
 maximum increase of snow depth; days with and without ice; depth of 
 ice; freezing and thawing dates for bodies of water; density and 
 thickness of the ice; frost dates; depth of the frost; disappearance 
 of the frost; earliest and latest snowfall; dates of maximum snow 
 cover; and snow cover duration. The following maps are contained in 
 the data: number of days for snow cover; snow depth for selected 
 dates; number of days for ice cover on lakes and seas; and for ice 
 breakup dates. 
 
 These books are part of the foreign meteorological data collection 
 held by the NOAA Central Library in Washington, DC. Information in 
 this collection dates back to the 18th century for daily, monthly, 
 seasonal, and annual tabular summaries, and the 19th century for 
 weather maps. These data are the result of foreign exchange 
 agreements, but the collection has not been updated since 1983.
