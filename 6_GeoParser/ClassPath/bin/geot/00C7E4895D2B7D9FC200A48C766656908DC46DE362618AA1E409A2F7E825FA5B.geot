                            Abstract: 
                            INDICATOR DEFINITION 
 Monthly lowest temperatures obtained from observed daily minimum temperatures for Australian Antarctic stations Casey, Davis, Mawson and Macquarie Island. 
 
 TYPE OF INDICATOR 
 There are three types of indicators used in this report: 
 1.Describes the CONDITION of important elements of a system; 
 2.Show the extent of the major PRESSURES exerted on a system; 
 3.Determine RESPONSES to  ... either condition or changes in the condition of a system. 
 
 This indicator is one of: CONDITION 
 
 RATIONALE FOR INDICATOR SELECTION 
 Global climate models show warming in response to increased greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide, methane etc) concentrations in the atmosphere; this is called the 'enhanced greenhouse effect'. Because of this, there is interest in observations of temperature across the globe, including Antarctica. Extensive high-quality observations from fixed locations are essential to serve as direct indicators of temperature changes and also confirm climate model output. 
 
 DESIGN AND STRATEGY FOR INDICATOR MONITORING PROGRAM 
 Spatial Scale: Australian Antarctic stations: Casey (lat 66 degrees 16' 54.5" S, long 110 degrees 31' 39.4" E), Davis (lat 68 degrees 34' 35.8" S, long 77 degrees 58' 02.6" E), Mawson (lat 67 degrees 36' 09.7" S, long 62 degrees 52' 25.7" E) and Macquarie Island (lat 54 degrees 37' 59.9" S, long 158 degrees 52' 59.9" E). 
 
 Temporal scale: Monthly. 
 
 Measurement Technique: Thermometry. 
 
 RESEARCH ISSUES 
 There is need to develop a high-quality data set from the available data, correcting erroneous data and estimating missing data. Adjustment may be necessary for changes in site location or exposure, and for changes in instrumentation or observing practices. 
 
 Some of these changes are documented in the station history files held by the Regional Observations Section. These history files are currently held as paper records, although more recent information is held electronically and there is an effort to digitise the older records. 
 
 Before the data can be used for the detection of change, a concerted effort will need to be made to identify deficiencies in the data, and then make compensations where possible. This is made more difficult by the lack of suitable comparison sites.

        Quality
        
            Lowest monthly temperatures are obtained by taking the lowest of the observed minimum temperatures for individual days of a given month. The daily minima are currently derived from temperature sensors sampling at 1 second intervals. If less than 25 days are available in any month, the monthly figure is flagged and removed from the State of Environment dataset. 
 
 The  ... monthly air temperature anomaly is calculated as the difference between the lowest air temperature for a given month and the long-term mean lowest air temperature for that calendar month between 1971 and 2000, so that: 
 
 Anomaly (for given month) = Value (for given month) - Long-term Mean (for relevant calendar month) 
 
 Although the Bureau of Meteorology uses the period from 1961 to 1990 as the standard period for calculation of long-term means, it was decided that for Antarctic stations, the 1971-2000 dataset was in most cases more complete, and would therefore provide a more accurate long-term mean. 
 
 These records require analysis for variability and trends. However, there are likely to be significant errors in the data, and these need to be addressed first (see Research Issues).
