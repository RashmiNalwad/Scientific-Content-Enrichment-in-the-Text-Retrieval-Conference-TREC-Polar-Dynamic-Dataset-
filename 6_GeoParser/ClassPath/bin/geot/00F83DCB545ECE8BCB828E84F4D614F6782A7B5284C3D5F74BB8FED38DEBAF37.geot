                            Since about 1773 when the British captain James Cook first crossed
      the Antarctic Circle a vast amount of scientific data on conditions
      around Antarctica have been collected. Many of these ...

                            In the proces of studying the dynamics of Antarctic ice shelves
      based on historic expedition maps, a map catalogue was compiled. This
      catalogue contains descriptions of (copies of) maps ...
