        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The main purpose of the Wind spacecraft is to measure the incoming 
 solar wind, magnetic fields and particles, although early on it will 
 also observe the Earth's foreshock region. Wind, together with 
 Geotail, Polar, SOHO, and Cluster projects, constitute a cooperative 
 scientific satellite project designated the International Solar 
 Terrestrial Physics (ISTP) program which aims at gaining improved 
  ... understanding of the physics of solar terrestrial relations. 
 
 The WAVES investigation on the WIND spacecraft provides comprehensive 
 coverage of radio and plasma wave phenomena in the frequency range 
 from a fraction of a Hertz up to about 14 MHz for the electric field 
 and 3 kHz for the magnetic field. This package will permit several 
 kind of measurements, all of which are essential to understanding the 
 Earth's environment --the Geospace-- and its response to varying solar 
 wind conditions. In situ measurements of different modes of plasma 
 waves will give information on local processes and couplings in 
 different regions and boundaries of the Geospace leading to plasma 
 instabilities: magneto-acoustic waves, ion cyclotron waves, whistler 
 waves, electron plasma oscillations, electron burst noise and other 
 types of electrostatic or electromagnetic waves.
