        Summary


        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The National Map viewer is the USGS's geographic information system (GIS) 
 application which is designed to provide easy access to geospatial information. 
 The viewer is a Web-enabled portal to all of the geospatial information 
 contained in The National Map. This portal not only supports on-line access to 
 the geospatial information, but also allows the download of digital data and 
 creation of  ... cartographic products. 
 
 The National Map 
 
 The National Map provides public domain core geographic data about the United 
 States and its territories that other agencies can extend, enhance, and 
 reference as they concentrate on maintaining other data that are unique to 
 their needs. The National Map will be a foundation of information to which the 
 private sector can contribute core feature content and to which proprietary 
 datasets can be linked to provide access to higher resolution data, additional 
 (non-base) features, and enriched attribute information. The National Map will 
 promote cost effectiveness by minimizing the need to find, develop, integrate, 
 and maintain geographic base data each time they are needed. 
 
 The National Map will provide data and operational capabilities that include 
 the following: 
 
 1. High-resolution digital orthorectified imagery from aerial photographs or 
 satellite imagery that will provide some of the feature information now 
 symbolized on topographic maps. 
 
 2. High-resolution surface elevation data including bathymetry to derive 
 contours for primary series topographic maps and to support Earth surface 
 modeling and the production of accurate orthorectified imagery. 
 
 3. Vector feature data for hydrography (rivers and water bodies), 
 transportation (roads, railways, and waterways), structures, government unit 
 boundaries, and publicly-owned lands boundaries. 
 
 4. Geographic names for physical and cultural features to support the U.S. 
 Board on Geographic Names and other names such as for highways and streets. 
 
 5. Land cover data that classify the land surface into categories such as open 
 water and high-density residential. 
 
 The National Map is a new perspective on geographic base information. By 
 sharing its vision, the USGS affirms its dedication to refocusing and 
 reinvigorating its efforts to meet the Nation's needs for this critical 
 information. The USGS will consolidate and redefine its component mapping 
 activities and seek creative partnerships to ensure that current, complete, 
 consistent, and accurate information is available and useful to the Nation. It 
 will take sustained commitment to achieve the full goals of The National Map 
 vision. In the near future, the USGS and its partners will concentrate on 
 improving data and map content and currentness for high priority areas, with 
 emphasis on building long-term partnerships, and on improving data access and 
 dissemination capabilities.
