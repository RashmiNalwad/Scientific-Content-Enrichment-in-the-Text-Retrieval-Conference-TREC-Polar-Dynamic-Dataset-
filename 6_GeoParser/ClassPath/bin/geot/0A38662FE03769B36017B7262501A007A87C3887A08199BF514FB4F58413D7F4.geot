	Description:
	
                  	Abstract:
	
                        
                        High frequency Doppler Radios (HFDR) are used to measure surface currents averaged half-hourly to a distance of more than
                        100 km (60 miles). They consist of a low-power transmitter sending radio waves in the 15-30 MHz frequency band, and receivers
                        listening for the signal reflected back from ocean waves. The reflected signal contains information about wave motion,  surface
                        currents, and wind direction. While efforts have  been made to implement HFDR data collection as accurately as possible, sources
                        of error remain. Real-time HFDR data are not  quality-controlled. Quality control is a manual iterative process, involving
                        calibration against other data sets, and may take months or even years. Because the real-time data lack quality control, they
                        should never be used as primary source of information for life-critical applications, such as ocean navigation, routing, or
                        search-and-rescue. General liability waivers apply.
                        PacIOOS provides timely, reliable, and accurate ocean information to support a safe, clean, productive ocean and resilient
                        coastal zone in the U.S. Pacific Islands region.
