						Webcasts You Don't Want to Miss

			 NASA’s Digital Learning Network, or DLN, has special events coming up in May that you won’t want to miss. DLN provides free, interactive webcasts and videoconferences with NASA experts. A webcast is a live event broadcast over the Internet. These events may be archived later for on-demand viewing. 

Four DLN special events relating to DIY Podcast modules will be shown in May. 

    May 2, 2012, 9:30-10:30 a.m. EDT  
    Meet astronaut Sunita Williams as she prepares for Expedition 33 to the International
    Space Station. Williams will share her journey to NASA, mission experiences and the
    exciting science she will conduct while living on the International Space Station. 
    Become a part of her mission by participating in this interactive webcast. 

    May 11, 2012, 2-3 p.m. EDT  
    NASA scientist Tara Ruttley will answer questions from students in grades 
    4-12 about conducting research on the International Space Station and the
    benefits of these experiments in helping to sustain life in space and enhance
    life on Earth.

   May 15, 2012, Noon to 1 p.m. EDT  
   Join NASA’s Johnson Space Center live from the Space Vehicle Mock-up
   Facility as we celebrate the Soyuz launch of astronaut Joe Acaba and the
   Expedition 31 crew. Learn about the upcoming mission to the space station
   and meet an astronaut trainer.

   May 17, 2012, 1-2 p.m. EDT  
   Talk with David Fuller, NASA flight systems engineer, about space and its effect
    on humans. Many issues need to be solved before humans can go on long-duration
    space missions, and he can answer some of your questions about long space travel. 

These events may give students extra background information and a chance to ask a specific question of a NASA expert. They could be helpful if students are creating podcast episodes using these modules:


	
	Fitness	
	Space Station
	
	Micro-g	
	Spacesuits
	
	Solar Arrays	
	Sports Demo




The webcasts that I’ve mentioned are called “special events.” Beside these, you should check out the Event Catalog to schedule a DLN event that meets your needs.
