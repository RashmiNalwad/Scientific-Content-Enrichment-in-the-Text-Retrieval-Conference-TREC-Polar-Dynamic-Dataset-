                            Abstract: 
                            Meteorological and sea surface parameters were observed continuously along the 
 ship's track during sixty-seven US GLOBEC cruises to the Georges Bank region, 
 years 1995-1999. The data are reported by cruise in files of one, fifteen, and 
 sixty minute values/averages.
