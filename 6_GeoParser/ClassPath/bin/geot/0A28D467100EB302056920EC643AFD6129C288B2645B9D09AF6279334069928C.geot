    Description

    
         
            
            
                [Note: "With some minor improvements regarding instrument operations, the VEGETATION-2 instrument is identical in its technical specification to VEGETATION flown on SPOT-4", Source: Earth Observation Satellites & Sensors for Risk Management home page, http://www.space-risks.com/SpaceData/index.php?Satellite_Name=SPOT+... ]

                 The SPOT 4 satellite carries on-board a low-resolution wide-coverage instrument for monitoring the continental biosphere and to monitor crops. The VEGETATION instrument provides global coverage on an almost daily basis at a resolution of 1 kilometer with a swath of 2250 km, enabling the observation of long-term environmental changes on a regional and worldwide scale. 


		
            
                 


		
            
                 The VEGETATION program is being co-funded by the European Union, Belgium, France, Italy and Sweden and led by French space agency CNES.
