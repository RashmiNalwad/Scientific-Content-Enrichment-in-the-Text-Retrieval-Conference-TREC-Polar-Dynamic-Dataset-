        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            [Summary adapted from the NDP-055 documentation] 
 
 This numeric data package (NDP-055) describes a land-use and biomass 
 database for Tropical Africa that contains 1980 land cover, maximum 
 potential aboveground biomass, and biomass estimates for woody 
 vegetation in 1980. In addition, the database includes information on 
 human populations in each nation and sub-national political unit in 
 Tropical  ... Africa for the years 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990. These data 
 were collected to reduce the uncertainty associated with the possible 
 magnitude and time course of historical release of carbon from 
 land-cover change and may be used by demographers, historians, 
 geographers, and other researchers interested in the relationship 
 between land cover change, land degradation, climate, and 
 anthropogenic activities. 
 
 For purposes of the NDP, Tropical Africa is defined as encompassing 
 nearly 22.7 x 10^6 km^2 of the world's surface and includes the 
 following countries: Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, 
 Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Benin, Equatorial Guinea, 
 Ethiopia, Djibouti, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Kenya, 
 Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, 
 Niger, Nigeria, Guinea-Bissau, Zimbabwe (Rhodesia), Rwanda, Senegal, 
 Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Burkina Faso 
 (Upper Volta), Zaire, and Zambia. As defined here Tropical Africa does 
 not include countries in Mediterranean and southern Africa. 
 
 The database was developed using the GRID module in the ARC/INFO(TM) 
 geographic information system. Source data were obtained from the Food 
 and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the U.S. National Geophysical Data 
 Center, and a limited number of biomass-carbon density case studies. 
 These data were used to derive the maximum potential and actual (ca. 
 1980) aboveground biomass values at regional and country levels. The 
 land-use data provided were derived from a vegetation map originally 
 produced for the FAO by the International Institute of Vegetation 
 Mapping, Toulouse, France. 
 
 Analyses conducted with this database found that 18% of Tropical 
 Africa was in closed forest and 36% was in open forest in 1980. These 
 forested lands contained over 138 x 109 Mg of aboveground live 
 biomass, equivalent to 69 x 109 Mg of carbon. Closed forests and open 
 forests had mean aboveground biomass values of 209 Mg/ha and 67 Mg/ha, 
 respectively, in 1980. These values are down from maximum potential 
 aboveground live biomass values of 296 Mg/ha for closed forest and 108 
 Mg/ha for open forest. 
 
 These data are available as a Numeric Data Package (NDP) from the 
 Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (via mail or FTP). The 26 
 files consist of seven ARC/INFOTM export files, eight flat ASCII data 
 files, ten FORTRAN and SAS(TM) data retrieval files, and one 
 descriptive file that explains the contents and format of each data 
 file. The documentation contains information on the methods used in 
 calculating each variable; detailed descriptions of file contents and 
 formats; and a discussion of the sources, restrictions, and 
 limitations of the data.
