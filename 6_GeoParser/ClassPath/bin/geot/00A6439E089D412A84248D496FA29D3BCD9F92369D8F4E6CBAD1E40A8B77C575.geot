                            Abstract: 
                            Amery Ice Shelf AM04 borehole drilled mid-January 2006. Sub-shelf water profiling measurements conducted over a period of a few days. Partial video recording of borehole walls and sea floor benthos. 
 Collection of targeted ice core samples. Sediment sample collected from sea floor. Long term monitoring instruments installed (thermistors in ice, 3 x CTD in ocean cavity).
