                            Abstract: 
                            The NSF-supported research icebreaker Laurence M. Gould operates year-round in support of the U.S. Antarctic Program, carrying out global change studies in biological, chemical, physical, and oceanographic disciplines. 
 This data set consists of underway data from leg LMG0601 on the R/V Laurence M. Gould. This leg started at Punta Arenas, Chile and ended at Punta Arenas, Chile.
