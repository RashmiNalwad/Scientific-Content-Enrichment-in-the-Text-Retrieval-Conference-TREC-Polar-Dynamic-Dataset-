                    Service Provider Description

                    
                        
                            The Center for Wave Phenomena (CWP) at the Colorado School of Mines supports a graduate level interdisciplinary research and education program in seismic exploration, monitoring and wave propagation. The main focus of the CWP program is on seismic modeling, imaging, and inversion methods, as well as on improving the accuracy and efficiency of seismic processing algorithms, especially for application to regions of structural complexity. 

 

 CWP, established at the Colorado School of Mines in 1984, is partially supported by an international consortium of 23 oil and service companies as well as various government agencies. Housed in the Geophysics Department in the Green Center, we have excellent computational facilities. 

 

 The principal investigators and faculty are Dave Hale, Paul Sava, Roel Snieder and Ilya Tsvankin, as well as Norm Bleistein (CWP co-founder & university emeritus professor), and Ken Larner (university emeritus professor). 

 

 We invite you to browse these pages to learn more about the CWP faculty and students, and about our research and Consortium Project.
