        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            This data set contains a series of land surface parameters simulated 
 from the Noah land-surface model (LSM) for Phase 2 of the North 
 American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The data are in 
 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. 
 The temporal resolution is hourly. The file format is WMO GRIB-1. 
 
 Details about the NLDAS-2 configuration of the Noah LSM can be 
 found  ... in Xia et al. (2012). 
 
 The Noah model was developed as the land component of the NOAA NCEP 
 mesoscale Eta model [Betts et al. (1997); Chen et al. (1997); Ek et 
 al. (2003)]. As used in NLDAS-2, recent modifications were made to 
 Noah's cold-season [Livneh et al. (2010)] and warm-season [Wei et 
 al. (2012)] parameterizations. Noah serves as the land component in the 
 evolving Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional atmospheric 
 model, the NOAA NCEP coupled Climate Forecast System (CFS), and the 
 Global Forecast System (GFS). The model simulates the soil freeze-thaw 
 process and its impact on soil heating/cooling and transpiration, 
 following Koren et al. (1999). The model has four soil layers with 
 spatially invariant thicknesses of 10, 30, 60, and 100 cm. The first 
 three layers form the root zone in non-forested regions, with the fourth 
 layer included in forested regions. 
 
 The Noah LSM was forced by the hourly NLDAS-2 forcing "File A" files, 
 and contains fifty-two fields. The data set applies a user-defined 
 parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter number. The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_NLDAS_NOA...) shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition Section (PDS) IDs and units.
