        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            MODIS is a 36-band spectroradiometer measuring visible and infrared radiation and obtaining data in Antarctic, Arctic, Korea Peninsula. The first MODIS instrument was launched on board the Terra satellite in December 1999.     
                        

                    
                    
                        
                            

                            Purpose: 
                            Derive products ranging from vegetation, land surface cover, and ocean chlorophyll fluorescence to cloud and aerosol properties, fire occurrence, snow cover on the land, and sea ice cover on the oceans.
