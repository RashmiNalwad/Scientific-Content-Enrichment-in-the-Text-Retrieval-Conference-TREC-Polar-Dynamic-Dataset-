                            Abstract: 
                            ETI's World Biodiversity Database is a continuously growing taxonomic 
 database and information system that aims at documenting all presently 
 known species (about 1.7 million) and to make this important 
 biological information worldwide accessible. The WBD contains 
 taxonomic information (hierarchies), species names, synonyms, 
 descriptions, illustrations and literature  ... references when 
 available. A direct link to CMBI provides genetic information on 
 protein sequence (from the PIR database) and nucleic sequence (from 
 the EMBL database) for each taxon. In the future the WBD will be 
 extended with online identification keys and an interactive geographic 
 information system. A section of the WBD is available on CD-ROM. Those 
 parts of ETI's WBD that represent so called Global Species Databases 
 (full worldwide coverage on specific taxa) will be linked to the 
 Species 2000 Index of Species, a virtual basic taxonomic reference 
 system, that is continuously updated by quality taxonomic 
 databases. The Species 2000 Index acts as a basic species name 
 references system that can help you to locate detailed information on 
 species in the member databases. The database, constructed in 
 cooperation with the Stichting Academisch Rekencentrum Amsterdam 
 (SARA), currently contains over 200.000 accessible taxa. 
 
 The WBD is intended to increase understanding and to support a 
 responsible use and to facilitate the management of the earths 
 biodiversity resources. It is built as a joint effort of specialists 
 worldwide who contribute basic taxonomic, ecological and biodiversity 
 data to ETI to make this available in electronic form, both online in 
 the WBD and in subsections on CD-ROMs
