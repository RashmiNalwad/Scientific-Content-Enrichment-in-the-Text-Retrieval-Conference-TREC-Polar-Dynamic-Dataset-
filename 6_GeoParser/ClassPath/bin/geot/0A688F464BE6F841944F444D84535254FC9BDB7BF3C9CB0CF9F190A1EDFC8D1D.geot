        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            ---- Public Summary from Project ---- 
 This project is designed to provide an understanding of the interactions between krill, other zooplankton, the physical environment and the predators dependent on krill. This will directly address a number of pressing problems facing CCAMLR (the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources) in its attempts to manage the krill fishery  ... using an 'ecosystem approach'. 
 
 Expected outcomes: 
 As a result of logistic operations (i.e. diversion to Casey) the 29 days on site allocated to this work was reduced to 10 days. Hence only a fraction of the intended program of work was conducted. 
 
 Acoustics: 
 Acoustics data (for 38, 120, 200kHz) was collected for the top 250m of the water column for nine and a half of the planned 13 transects in our 60 x 60 nautical mile survey region.
