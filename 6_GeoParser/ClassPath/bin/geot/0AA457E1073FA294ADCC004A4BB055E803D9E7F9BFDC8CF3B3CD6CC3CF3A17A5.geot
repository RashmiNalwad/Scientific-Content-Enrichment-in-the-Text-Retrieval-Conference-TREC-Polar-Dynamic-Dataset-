                Definition:

                
                    The condition that exists when, over a widespread area, the surface
temperature of the air remains  below freezing 0 C (32 F) for a sufficient
amount of time to constitute the characteristic feature of the weather. A
freeze is a term used for the condition when vegetation is injured by
these low air temperatures, regardless if frost were deposited.
