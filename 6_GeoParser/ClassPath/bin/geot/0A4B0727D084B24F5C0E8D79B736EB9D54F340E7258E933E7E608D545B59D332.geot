        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The key scientific uncertainty in the global warming debate is the equilibrium 
 climate sensitivity. Coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models 
 predict a wide range of equilibrium climate sensitivities, with a consequently 
 large spread of societal implications. Comparison of models with instrumental 
 data has not been able to reduce the uncertainty in climate sensitivity. An 
  ... alternative way to gauge equilibrium climate sensitivity is to use 
 paleoclimatic data. Two recent advances, the development and application of 
 proxy recorders of tropical sea surface temperature (SST) and the 
 synchronization of the deep-sea and Antarctic ice-core time scales, make it 
 possible to directly relate past changes in tropical SST to atmospheric carbon 
 dioxide (CO2) levels. The strong correspondence of a proxy SST record from the 
 eastern equatorial Pacific and the Vostok CO2 record suggests that varying 
 atmospheric carbon dioxide is the dominant control on tropical climate on 
 orbital time scales. This effect is especially pronounced at the 100,000-yr 
 cycle. Calibration of the CO2 influence via tropical SST variability indicates 
 a tropical climate sensitivity of 4.4°-5.6°C (errors estimated at ± 1.0°C) for 
 a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration. This result suggests that the 
 equilibrium response of tropical climate to atmospheric CO2 changes is likely 
 to be similar to the upper end of available global predictions from coupled 
 models.
