        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Australian Antarctic Division chartered vessels routinely collect environmental information as they move around the Southern Ocean. The type of data collected varies depending on the vessel (and exactly what sensors are in place on each ship). 
 
 Underway data typically include a number of meteorological and oceanographic parameters (such as sea surface temperature, air temperature, humidity, UV  ... levels, water depth, salinity, etc) as well as ship parameters (such as heading, speed, position, etc). 
 
 Data can typically be extracted via the Marine Science Underway Data Tool, available at the URL given below. Data can be extracted in various formats (such as text, excel, netcdf) and in various permutations. 
 
 Underway data collection began in 1985 on the Nella Dan. 
 
 See all the child metadata records for detailed information on each cruise. 
 
 The Entry_IDs of the child metadata records can be interpreted as follows: 
 
 eg 198586010 
 
 198586 - Antarctic season 1985/1986 
 010 - voyage number - in this case voyage 1. The trailing 0 is present in case a voyage was conducted in more than 1 cruise, as was the case for 198990072.
