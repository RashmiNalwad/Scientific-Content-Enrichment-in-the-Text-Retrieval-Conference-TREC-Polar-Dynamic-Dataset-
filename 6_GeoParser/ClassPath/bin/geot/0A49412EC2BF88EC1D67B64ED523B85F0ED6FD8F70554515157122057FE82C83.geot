        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            SICOPOLIS (SImulation COde for POLythermal Ice Sheets) is a 3-d dynamic/thermodynamic model which simulates the evolution of large ice sheets. It was originally created as a part of the doctoral dissertation by Greve (1995) in a version for the Greenland ice sheet [English journal publications: Greve (1997a,b)]. Since then, SICOPOLIS has been developped continuously and applied to problems of  ... past, present and future glaciation of Greenland, Antarctica, the entire northern hemisphere and also the polar ice caps of the planet Mars. 
 
 The model is based on the shallow ice approximation, so that longitudinal stress gradients are neglected. It is coded in Fortran 90 and uses finite-difference discretization on a staggered grid, the velocity components being taken between grid points. Its particularity is the detailed treatment of basal temperate layers (that is, regions with a temperature at the pressure melting point), which are positioned by fulfilling a Stefan-type jump condition at the interface to the cold-ice regions. Within the temperate layers, the water content is computed, and its influence on the ice viscosity is taken into account.
