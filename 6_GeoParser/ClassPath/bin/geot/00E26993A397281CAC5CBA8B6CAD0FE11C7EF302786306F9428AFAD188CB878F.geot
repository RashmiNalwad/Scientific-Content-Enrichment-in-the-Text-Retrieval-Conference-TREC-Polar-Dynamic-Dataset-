        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Forest Ecosystem Dynamics Multisensor Airborne Campaign (FED MAC): 
 Airborne Laser Polarization Experiment 
 
 The Biospheric Sciences Branch (formerly Earth Resources Branch) 
 within the Laboratory for Terrestrial Physics at NASA's Goddard Space 
 Flight Center and associated University investigators are involved in 
 a research program entitled Forest Ecosystem  ... Dynamics (FED) which is 
 fundamentally concerned with vegetation change of forest ecosystems at 
 local to regional spatial scales (100 to 10,000 meters) and temporal 
 scales ranging from monthly to decadal periods (10 to 100 years). The 
 nature and extent of the impacts of these changes, as well as the 
 feedbacks to global climate, may be addressed through modeling the 
 interactions of the vegetation, soil, and energy components of the 
 boreal ecosystem. 
 
 A new remote sensing instrument, the Airborne Laser Polarization 
 Sensor (ALPS), mounted on a helicopter, was used to make multispectral 
 radiometric and polarization measurements of the Earth's surface using 
 a polarized laser light source. The ALPS system consists of a pulsed, 
 polarized laser source, an optical receiver package, a video camera and 
 recorder, and data acquisition and analysis hardware and software. The 
 choice of laser wavelengths is limited to frequencies from the 
 ultraviolet to the near-infrared by the photo-cathode response of the 
 selected photo multiplier tube (PMT) detectors. Twelve PMTs were used 
 corresponding to the 12 channels of data: Channels 1,2,3,4,9 & 10 have 
 1090 nm bandpass filters. The reminder are for 532 nm. Channels 9 and 
 11 have no polarization filters. 
 
 For each wavelength, polarization filters are mounted in front of each 
 PMT at angles relative to the transmitted polarization. A pulsed (7 ns) 
 Nd:YAG laser is employed. It operates in the infrared at 1060 nm and 
 the visible at 532 nm. The 532 nm green wavelength can be seen near 
 the center of the TV screen as it hits the surface in most cases. This 
 is used for ground truth correlation. The spot is about 20 cm in 
 diameter from 100 meters altitude. 
 
 In these data for ALPS Experiment for the FED MAC 90, the file 
 tabulation refers to data files taken on September 9 and 11. A 
 standard VHS video tape is available (the master tapes are recorded at 
 the SP speed on Super-VHS). The first half of this tape is from a 
 camera coaxial with the laser transmission. Time on the tape 
 correspond to file times while oral comments on the tape supplement 
 the general comments. The second half of the tape consists primarily 
 of site descriptive narration on the ground and some pictures of the 
 helicopter setup.
