                            Abstract: 
                            Micrometeorological observations at an unattended observation station near the 
 center of the Yukidori Valley, Langhovde, Antarctica were carried out 
 continuously at intervals of thirty minutes from 1988 to 1989. 
 Observation items measured include humidity, wind speed, and temperature (on the 
 moss and rock), etc. 
 
 The input data capacity of latitude and longitude values are limited 
 only to degrees. 
 The exact values are as follows: 
 Min. Latitude: 69deg. 15min. S 
 Max. Latitude: 69deg. 15min. S 
 Min. Longitude: 39deg. 46min. E 
 Max. Longitude: 39deg. 46min. E
