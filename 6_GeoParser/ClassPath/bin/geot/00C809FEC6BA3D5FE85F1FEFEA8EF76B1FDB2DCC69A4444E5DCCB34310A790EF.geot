                            Abstract: 
                            This is a parent record for a number of metadata records with links to scanned copies of biology logs from Australian Antarctic and subantarctic stations - 1948-1991. The logs include observations, notes and photographs of seals, penguins, petrels, skuas, whales, fishing, etc, as well as some general information on bird banding procedures, inductions, instructions, etc. 
 
 The documents have been collected form Macquarie Island, Casey, Davis, Wilkes, Mawson and the Windmill Islands. 
 
 Hard copies of the documents have been archived by the Australian Antarctic Division library.
