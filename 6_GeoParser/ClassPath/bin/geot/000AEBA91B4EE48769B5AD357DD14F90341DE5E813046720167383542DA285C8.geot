                            Abstract: 
                            The Earthquake Information Distribution System (EIDS) provides a method for receiving earthquake data over the Internet in near-real time. EIDS replaces the Quake Data Distribution System (QDDS) and provides either CUBE or EQXML formatted output messages.
