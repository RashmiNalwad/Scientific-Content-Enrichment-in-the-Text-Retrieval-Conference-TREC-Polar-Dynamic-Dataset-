Subject: new LCA sinex series lcawd30


Dear colleagues,


A new series lcawd30 of SINEX solutions is now available at IDS Data Centers.
It results from a complete reprocessing to take into account upgrades
brought to the software (attitude laws revised, bug related to
the frequency bias solved) and the modeling, since the configuration set up
for IDS-3. It includes SPOT-2, -3, -4, -5, Topex, Envisat, Jason-2 and 
Cryosat-2.

Compared to the previous series lcawd20,24,26,28 delivered to IDS for and
in continuity of the IDS-3 realization, we use:
-DPOD2008 as a priori instead of DPOD2005, and for discontinuities and data
rejection.
-IERS EOP series aligned on ITRF2008
-GMF/GPT tropospheric model instead of zenith delay derived from ECMWF
meteorological model and Guo&Langley mapping function
-EIGEN-6S gravity model instead of EIGEN-GL04S


A new macro-model tuned by GRGS Toulouse team is used for Jason-2
The phase wind-up effect has been implemanted in GINS and is used in the
data processing.

For more details, see the series description form
doris/products/sinex_series/lcawd/lcawd30.snx.dsc


Sp3 orbit files of all the DORIS missions obtained from this reprocessing
will be provided soon to IDS Data Centers,
as well as STCD files for the station coordinate time series.

LCA will now resumed its routine processing and delivery to IDS.


Best regards,

Laurent Soudarin
on behalf of the LCA team.
