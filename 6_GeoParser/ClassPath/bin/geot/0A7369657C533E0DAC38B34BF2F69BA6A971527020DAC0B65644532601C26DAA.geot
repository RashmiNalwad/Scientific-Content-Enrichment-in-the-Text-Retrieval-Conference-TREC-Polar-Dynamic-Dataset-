                            Abstract: 
                            The BOREAS TGB-01 and TGB-03 teams collected several data sets that contributed to understanding the measured trace gas fluxes over sites in the NSA. This data set contains NEE measurements collected with chambers at the NSA fen in 1994 and 1996. Gas samples were extracted approximately every 7 days from chambers and analyzed at the NSA lab facility.
