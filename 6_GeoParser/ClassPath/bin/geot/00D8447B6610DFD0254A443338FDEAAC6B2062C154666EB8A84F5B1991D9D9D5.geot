Description


    MAXIS (MeV Auroral X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy): 
 
 Launched: January 12, 2000 
 
 Purpose of Flight: 
 
 To study electron precipitation from the magnetosphere into the 
 ionosphere. This electron  ... precipitation creates the aurora 
 (northern and southern lights) along with X-rays which can be 
 observed with our balloon instrumentation. For this project, the 
 University of Washington provided a bismuth germanate (BGO) 
 X-ray spectrometer and two X-ray imaging cameras. One camera has 
 a pinhole collimator and the other has a coded aperture mask 
 collimator. Both cameras use scintillating crystals and 
 photomultiplier tubes to detect X-rays which are produced in the 
 aurora. The Berkeley balloon group provided a high resolution 
 germanium X-ray spectrometer. All of these instruments flew on 
 the INTERBOA campaign in 1996, where they observed an unusual 
 relativistic electron precipitation event. 
 
 The MAXIS balloon was terminated on January 30, 2000 at 22:13 UT 
 after a successful 450 hour flight.
