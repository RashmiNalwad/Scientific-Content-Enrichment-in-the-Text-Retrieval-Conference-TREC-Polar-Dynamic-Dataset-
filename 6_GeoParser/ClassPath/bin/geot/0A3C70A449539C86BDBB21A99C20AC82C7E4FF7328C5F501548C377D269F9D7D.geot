                            Abstract: 
                            This data product contains TOMS/EP UV Reflectivity Daily and Monthly Zonal Means Version 8 data in ASCII format. 
 
 (The shortname for this Level-3 Earth Probe TOMS Product is TOMSEPL3zref) 
 
 The Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) Version 8 daily and monthly global gridded data consist of total column ozone, aerosol index, Lambertian effective surface reflectivity (Rayleigh corrected) and  ... surface UV-B erythemal irradiances. 
 
 Four TOMS instruments have been successfully flown on the following satellites: Nimbus-7 (Nov. 1978 - May 1993), Meteor-3 (Aug. 1991 - Dec. 1994), Earth Probe (July 1996 - current), and ADEOS (Sep. 1996 - June 1997). 
 
 Earth Probe, Meteor-3 and Nimbus-7 data are currently reprocessed using the Version-8 algorithm (http://toms.gsfc.nasa.gov/version8/v8toms_atbd.pdf) . These Version-8 data are archived at the Goddard Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC). 
 
 The total ozone, aerosol index, reflectivity data and UV-B Erythemal irradiances are mapped to a global grid of size 180 x 288 with a Lat/Lon resolution of 1.00 x 1.25 degrees. These data are also stored in the EOS version of Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS). HDF was developed by the National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
 
 TOMS data are produced by the Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (Code 613). The Version-8 Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) is available from the TOMS site http://toms.gsfc.nasa.gov/version8/v8toms_atbd.pdf

            WARNING: EP TOMS started experiencing calibration problem since 2002. For data beginning in year 2000, the calibration has been stabilized relative to NOAA-16 SBUV/2 in the equatorial zone. Because of continuing changes in the optical properties of the front scan mirror that are not well understood, data are showing a latitude dependent error that cannot be corrected by a simple calibration correction. The calibration appears to be stable near the equator. But by 50 degrees latitude, there is now a -2% to -4% error in TOMS, a bit larger in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere. Because of this error, data since 2002 should NOT be used for trend analysis
