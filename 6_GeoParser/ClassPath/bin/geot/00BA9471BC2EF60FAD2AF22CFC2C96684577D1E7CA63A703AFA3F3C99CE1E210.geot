        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            To better understand physical structure of the snow stratification, two 4m deep pits and two 2m deep pits were dug at several locations. The following items were investigated: (i) density with 3 cm resolution, (ii) dielectric permittivity measured using a “Snow Fork", (iii) dielectric permittivity measurement using Denoth method, (iv) temperature, (v) visual stratification, (vi) grain size of snow  ... and (v) snow type. With the same pits sampling of snow for chemical and physical analysis will be done. They are described elsewhere. 
 
 Site name, location, depth of the pit and date of the pit work are as follows. 
 (i) Relay Point (74°0’S, 43°00’E, and 3353-m above sea level) 
 2 m, 2007-11-30 
 (ii) Dome Fuji 
 4 m, 2007-12-10 to 2007-12-13 
 The location for the pit was (77°17.90’ S, 39°47.13’ E) about 3 km NE from the station. 
 (iii) CMOS-AWS point (76° 48’ S, 31° 54’ E, 3742 m above sea level) 
 2 m, 2007-12-20 
 (iv) JASE Meeting point (75°53’S; 25°50’E; 3661 m a.s.l.) 
 4 m, 2007-12-24 to 2007-12-26
