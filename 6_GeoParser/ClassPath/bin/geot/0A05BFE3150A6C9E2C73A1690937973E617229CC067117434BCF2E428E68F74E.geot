                Definition:

                
                    A computer-based system that aids the process of decision making or building of
knowledge. For example: a construction company has decided to build a new
development in a certain area, but they need to decide where to place the
buildings.  They may use information gathered on previous floods (i.e. stage
heights) to help them decide.
