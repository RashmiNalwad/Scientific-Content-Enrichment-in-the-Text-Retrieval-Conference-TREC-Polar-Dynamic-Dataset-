                    Project Description

                    
                        
                            
                            
                                 After a decade of fully operational functioning, the DORIS space 
 geodesy system has demonstrated its capabilities for 
 orbitography and navigation of the satellites and also ground 
 location. It plays a key rule in the Topex/Poseidon altimetric 
 mission for oceanography providing in association with the Laser 
 technique a 2 cm accuracy in the radial component of the 
 orbit. DORIS and Laser are renewed as the nominal orbitographic 
 system for the Jason mission (end of 2000). 
 
 DORIS also provides with Diode navigator on Spot 4 (1993), an 
 orbit in real time within a few meters. It's a world first at 
 this level of precision. 
 
 Since 1994 and thanks to its more than fifty permanent beacon 
 network, DORIS contributes to the IERS activities for the 
 realization and maintenance of the ITRS (International 
 Terrestrial Reference System). 3D positions and velocities of 
 the reference sites at a cm and mm/yr accuracy lead to 
 scientific studies (investigations) in the fields of global and 
 regional tectonics. Two recent DORIS results appear very 
 encouraging for the future. One concerns a seasonal effect of 
 earth surface fluid mass redistribution (oceanic water, 
 atmospheric masses, snow, ...) on the relative positions of the 
 earth mass and earth figure centers. Another concerns vertical 
 displacement of the crust monitored near tides-gages. This 
 information is of major interest for the topic of sea level 
 variations and correlation to the Global Change. 
 
 Such as the other space geodesy techniques GPS, VLBI, SLR, there 
 is a strong demand among the scientific community to create an 
 International DORIS Service, so called IDS. The CSTG, commission 
 for international co-ordination of space techniques for geodesy 
 of the International Association Geodesy (IAG) and the IERS 
 directing board decided in July 1999 to initiate a DORIS Pilot 
 Experiment. Its objective is to assess the need and feasibility 
 of an International DORIS Service.
