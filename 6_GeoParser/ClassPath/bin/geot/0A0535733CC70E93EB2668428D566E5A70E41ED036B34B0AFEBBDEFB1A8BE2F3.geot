        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Measurements of heart rate, ventilation rate and metabolic rate of Trematomus bernacchii subjected to elevated temperatures, including recovery from exercise and tolerance to hypoxia. The primary tools were respirometry and measurement of heart rate using e.c.g electrodes coupled to Powerlab recording equipment. Respirometry involved measuring oxygen consumption of the fish at a range of temperatures and environmental oxygen content in order to look at metabolic rate and whether this is affected by the ability of the gills to extract oxygen from the water. The e.c.g. work allowed simultaneous non-invasive measurement of heart rate and ventilation rate, both indicators of metabolic rate. 
 
 Further reaserch was carried out through the 2012-2013 research season.
