        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Measurements of heat flows and hence thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity in sea ice was measured in the absence of thermal radiation (i.e. sunlight, which dumps heat at depth in the ice and makes thermal measurements very difficult). The temperature depth profile was measured through the developing sea ice in McMurdo Sound with a 10cm resolution throughout the winter months until the  ... spring to determine the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of first year sea ice. Measurements were recorded on a data logger every hour and every two weeks the logger was serviced and the data retrieved. The rate of growth of the sea ice throughout the season can be determined and together with the recorded thermal information can be used to provide a history of the formation of the sea ice.
