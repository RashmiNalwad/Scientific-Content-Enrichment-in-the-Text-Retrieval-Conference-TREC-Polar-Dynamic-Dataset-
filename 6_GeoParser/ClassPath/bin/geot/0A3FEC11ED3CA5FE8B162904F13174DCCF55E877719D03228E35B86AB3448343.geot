        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            This data set includes ~50-m averaged annual layer thicknesses down to 3403 m depth at the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide ice core (WDC06A) as observed visually using diffuse transmitted light opposite a planed surface in a light-shielded booth in the core-processing line at the National Ice Core Lab in Denver, CO. Visual stratigraphy of each ~1-m-long segment of the entire WAIS Divide main core was conducted by the same individual (Matthew Spencer). Data reported here are average annual thicknesses (second column, in meters) preceded by that average’s depth from the surface (in meters), averaged over ~50-m depth, which is the depth range recorded per log book.     
                        

                    
                    
                        
                            

                            Purpose: 
                            The intellectual merit of the proposed activity starts with quality assurance for the core, by visual detection of any evidence of flow disturbances that would disrupt the integrity of the climate record. Inspection will also reveal any melt layers, volcanic horizons, etc. Annual-layer dating will be conducted; thus far, the visible strata have not been as useful as some other indicators, but the  ... possibility (based on experience in Greenland) that visible examination will allow detection of thinner annual layers than other techniques motivates the effort. Bubble number-density will be used to reconstruct temperature changes through the rest of the bubbly part of the core, providing important paleoclimatic data for earlier parts of the Holocene. Coordinated interpretation of c-axis fabrics, grain sizes and shapes, and bubble characteristics will be used to learn about the history of ice flow, the processes of ice flow, and the softness of the ice for additional deformation. Analysis of surface data already collected will improve interpretation of the layering of the core. It is possible that the annual-layer dating will not be sufficiently successful, and that the core will be undisturbed with no melt layers; if so, then these efforts will not yield major publications. However, success of the other efforts should produce improved understanding of the history and stability of the ice sheet, and key processes controlling these, and the quality assurance provided by the visual examination is important for the project as a whole.

                                The U.S research community is conducting a deep ice coring project in West Antarctica for studies of climate, ice sheet history and cryobiology. This project is collecting a deep ice core from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) ice flow divide and integrating approximately 40 separate but synergistic projects to analyze the ice and interpret the records.
