                            Abstract: 
                            This data set includes beta profiles, chemistry, and density data obtained from Dominion Range ice cores. The Dominion Range is on the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. The chemistry data consists of the composition of oxygen-isotopes and trapped gasses. Other information includes ice thickness, mean annual net accumulation, and crystal size. The core samples were collected in the austral summer of 1984-85.
