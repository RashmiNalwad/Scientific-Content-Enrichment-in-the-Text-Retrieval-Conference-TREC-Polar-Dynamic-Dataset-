                    Project Description

                    
                        
                            
                            
                                 The Antarctic Peninsula is the largest of ~ twelve micro-continental fragments between southern South America, East Antarctica, and New Zealand. Their original positions and movement history following Gondwana breakup are poorly constrained. Recent work on the Antarctic Peninsula fore-arc/arc/back-arc suggests it consists of two suspect terranes that originated elsewhere and collided with the Pacific margin of Gondwana in the Cretaceous. This study reviews provenance models for three laterally extensive, kilometers-thick sedimentary units in the Antarctic Peninsula using previous studies, and new sandstone detrital modes and chemistry. 1) The Trinity Peninsula Group accretionary complex (Triassic) was possibly derived from a glaciated continental margin and may consist of several accreted tracts.
