        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            Antarctic plate movement monitoring Geodynamics Research, the International Antarctic attention to the academic years of large-scale, long-period research project, belonging to the Antarctic environment for long-term changes in the scope of the study. Our country from the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" started in this field. From the beginning of 92 years, SCAR more than a dozen organizations to  ... coordinate more than 30 countries to participate in the annual Antarctic station for the 22 days of the Battle of the Joint Antarctic GPS measurements. China's two Antarctic stations from 94 years to start participating in international cooperation in the study. 
 
 GPS measurements by the International Joint SCAR-WGGGI organize a large-scale international cooperation in scientific research projects. With the aim of: 
 1) measurement of the Antarctic plate with the adjacent plate, as well as micro-plate relative motion between the rate and direction of its movement; 
 2) determine the Antarctic plate within the various pieces of the crust between the relative movement; 
 3) reunification of the Antarctic base of the vertical system, to determine the Antarctic stations tide elevation above sea level; 
 4), due to melting ice and ocean changes in the load caused by the Antarctic lithosphere, the vertical movement and so on, "the world's interaction with Antarctic" scientific research. 
 
 The GPS measurements of the International Alliance of time for the 2003 1 on 20 on 00:00 (UTC) -2003 year on February 10 24:00 (UTC), a total time of 22 days, the daily requirement for a 24-hour observation. Actual observation time for the January 10, 2003 to February 28, 2003. 
 The Alliance of the measured use of Trimble 4000 ssi by Wuhan University of Surveying and Mapping Institute, with its L1, L2 dual-phase output, and can accept yuan GPS satellite P code for the international advanced, high-precision, international joint testing and a number of global IGS (International GPS Service) site commonly used.
