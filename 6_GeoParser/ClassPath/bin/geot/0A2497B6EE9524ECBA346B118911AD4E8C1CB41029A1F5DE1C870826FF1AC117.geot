        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            This data set consists of Ras Umm Sidd bimonthly coral oxygen isotope 
 data (coral core RUS-95). 
 
 [Abstract] 
 A 245-year coral oxygen isotope record from the northern Red Sea (Ras 
 Umm Sidd/Egypt, ~28 deg. N) in bimonthly resolution is presented. The 
 mean annual coral d18O signal apparently reflects varying proportions 
 of both sea surface temperature and  ... d18Oseawater variability. In 
 conjunction with instrumental observations of climate the coral record 
 suggests for interannual and longer timescales that colder periods are 
 accompanied by more arid conditions in the northern Red Sea but 
 increased rainfall in the southeastern Mediterranean, whereas warmer 
 periods are accompanied by decreased rainfall in the latter and less 
 arid conditions in the northern Red Sea. A ~70-year oscillation of 
 probably North Atlantic origin dominates the coral time 
 series. Interannual to interdecadal variability is correlated with 
 instrumental indices of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the El 
 Nino- Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and North Pacific climate 
 variability. The results suggest that these modes contributed 
 consistently to Middle East climate variability since at least 1750, 
 preferentially at a period of ~5.7 years. 
 
 The coral core was collected in the end of November 1995 in the 
 northern Red Sea at Ras Umm Sidd (27 deg 50.9'N, 34 deg. 18.6'E) in 
 the Ras Mohammed National Park near the southern tip of the Sinai 
 Peninsula (Egypt), from a 2.6-m-high coral colony (Porites sp.) 
 growing at a water depth of ~5.5 m. The average annual growth rate of 
 the coral is 1 cm/year. The average sampling resolution for oxygen 
 isotope analysis is more than 6 samples per year. 
 
 The coral chronology is constructed by setting the maximum d18O value 
 in a given year equal to mid-February (consistent with the 
 climatological minimum in sea surface temperature) and assuming a 
 constant coral growth rate between February of every year. Therefore 
 we interpolated linearly between these fixed points for further age 
 assignments. The resulting values were interpolated linearly to six 
 equally spaced values per year, providing a bimonthly resolution. 
 
 The strong seasonal cycle in d18O was used to count annual layers in 
 the coral, supported by the consistent density banding pattern of 
 low-density band creation during winter and high-density band creation 
 during summer. The coral record extends from fall 1750 to fall 
 1995. We assigned an age model error of at least 2-3 months to the 
 coral chronology. In addition, we assigned an age model error of +/-1 
 year to the interval 1924-1783 and an additional +/-1 year to 
 1782-1750. Therefore the chronology is assigned a cumulative age model 
 error of less than +/-3 years at the bottom of the core.
