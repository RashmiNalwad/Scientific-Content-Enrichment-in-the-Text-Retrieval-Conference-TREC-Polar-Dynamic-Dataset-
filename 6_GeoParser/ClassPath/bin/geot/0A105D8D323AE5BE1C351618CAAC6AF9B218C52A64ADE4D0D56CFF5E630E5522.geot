        Summary

                
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) is building high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) for select U.S. coastal regions in the Gulf of Mexico. These integrated bathymetric-topographic DEMs were developed for NOAA Coastal Survey Development Laboratory (CSDL) through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 to evaluate the utility of the Vertical Datum  ... Transformation tool (VDatum), developed jointly by NOAA's Office of Coast Survey (OCS), National Geodetic Survey (NGS), and Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS). Bathymetric, topographic, and shoreline data used in DEM compilation are obtained from various sources, including NGDC, the U.S. Coastal Services Center (CSC), the U.S. Office of Coast Survey (OCS), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and other federal, state, and local government agencies, academic institutions, and private companies. DEMs are referenced to the vertical tidal 
 datum of North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (MHW), Mean High Water (MHW) or Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) and horizontal datum of North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Cell size ranges from 1/3 arc-second (~10 meters) to 1 arc-second (~30 meters). The NOAA VDatum DEM Project was funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 (http://www.recovery.gov/). 
    
                        

                    
                    
                        
                            

                            Purpose: 
                            Developed for the Office of Coast Survey (OCS), NOAA Coastal Survey Development Laboratory (CSDL) in support of NOAA's Vertical Datum Transformation tool (VDatum).
