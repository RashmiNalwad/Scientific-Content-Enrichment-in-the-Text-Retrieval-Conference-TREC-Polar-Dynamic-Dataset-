Description: A number of changes have been made to the text of Appendix A.24, The Soil Moisture Active-Passive Mission Science Team. The due date for proposals remains unchanged at February 1, 2013.
            

	A number of changes have been made to A.24 The Soil Moisture Active-Passive Mission Science Team (SMAP). We have increased the length of accepted proposed activity length from 40 months to 52 – this better aligns project activity with the life time of SMAP. We have increased the available monetary resources to $2M/year (up from 1.6M) and have indicated that this is to be used to select ~15 US members. New language emphasizes role of selected PIs in engaging the project strongly during the cal/val phase of SMAP (including the expectation of travel to JPL during that period). In addition, instructions for non-US proposers has been made available on the web, and web links are provided for the SMAP Algorithm Theoretical Basis Documents and a FAQ web page.


	For more information about A.24 SMAP please contact Jared Entin at  jared.k.entin@nasa.gov or 202-358-0275.
