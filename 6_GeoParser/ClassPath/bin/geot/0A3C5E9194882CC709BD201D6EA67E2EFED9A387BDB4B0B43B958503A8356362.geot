                Definition:

                
                    Pertaining to the measurement and analysis of ancient tree rings to
determine environmental conditions during that tree's lifetime and
extrapolate that to climatic conditions. The study of tree rings related to
past climate conditions is called dendroclimatology. Variations in tree ring
widths from year to year are recognized as an important source of chronological
and climatic information. The width of a tree ring is a function of many
variables including tree species, age, availability of stored food within the
tree, soil nutrients, and climatic factors such as precipitation, sunshine
temperature, winds and humidity.
