                Definition:

                
                    Any non-linear shaped opening enclosed by ice. May contain brash ice and/or
be covered with new ice, nilas or young ice; sub-mariners refer to these
as skylights. Polynyas are important in the study of the energy budget of
the polar ocean and local and regional climatology.
