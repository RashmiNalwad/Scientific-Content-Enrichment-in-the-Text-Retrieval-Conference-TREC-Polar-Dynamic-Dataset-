                            Abstract: 
                            The primary mission of the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar 
 Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) is to explore the basic physics of 
 particle acceleration and energy release in solar flares. RHESSI 
 consists of an X-Ray Imager and Germanium detector spectrometer. 
 
 Data available includes: 
 - Solar flare catalog: list of flares detected by RHESSI 
 - Light Curves: Time profiles of the RHESSI Observing Summary Count 
 Rate data 
 - Spectrograms 
 - Quicklook Images of reconstructed flare data 
 - Spectra
