                            Abstract: 
                            The data contains ASCII lat/long records extracted from the binary data. 
 
 The binary data are ice radar soundings at 150 MHz from Aircraft flown at about 100 knots. 
 
 This covers the priority flights in the Amery Ice Shelf area to look at the grounding zone between the ice shelf and Gillock Island. 
 
 The Radar unit was built by the Science and Technical Support  ... group of the Australian Antarctic Division. 
 
 This data are part of the Australian Antarctica and Southern Ocean Profiling Project (AASOPP) for continental mapping of the Australian continent.

        Access Constraints
        
            The ice radar files are stored in binary format, although a program (ReadRadar) is provided as part of the download to read the binary format and example C code to read the radar records. If you are unable to use this program, contact the technical contact to have the data converted for you. 
 
 These data are too large to be downloaded, so can be accessed by contacting the Australian Antarctic Data Centre and asking for a DVD copy.
