                            Abstract: 
                            The relationship between the processes of metamorphism, magmatism and deformation that took place during the Ross Orogeny has been investigated. Previous work has established that the relationship between intrusive igneous rocks and the metamorphosed sediments into which they are emplaced has enabled the relative age of events to be determined. The earliest plutons were intruded into already  ... metamorphosed sediments and the timing of this event is poorly understood. The distribution of intrusive plutonic igneous rocks, mainly granites and the metamorphosed sediments into which they were emplaced was investigated by mapping two field areas near the Carlyon and Mulock Glaciers, Reeves Bluff and the Western Worcester Range and collecting samples for geochemical and geochronological/radiometrical dating of the absolute age of metamorphism. Samples collected include granite, metasediment and Ferrar Dolerite.
