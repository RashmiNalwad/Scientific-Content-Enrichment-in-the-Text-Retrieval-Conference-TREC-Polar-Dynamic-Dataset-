                            Abstract: 
                            The SORCE SIM Solar Spectral Irradiance (SSI) data product SOR3SIMD is constructed using measurements from the SIM instruments, which are combined into merged daily solar spectra over the spectral range from 310 to 2413 nm at a spectral resolution ranging from 1 to 27 nm. Irradiances are reported at a mean solar distance of 1 AU and zero relative line-of-sight velocity with respect to the Sun. The  ... SIM absolute uncertainty is about 2%. 
 
 All of the SOR3SIMD data are arranged in a single file in a tabular ASCII text file which can be easily read into a spreadsheet application. The columns contain the date, Julian day, minimum wavelength, maximum wavelength, instrument mode, data version number, irradiance value, irradiance uncertainty, and data quality. The rows are arranged with data at each wavelength over the full SIM wavelength range, repeating for each day for the length of the measurement period.
