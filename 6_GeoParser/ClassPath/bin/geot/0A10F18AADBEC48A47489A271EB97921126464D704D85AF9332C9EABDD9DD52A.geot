        Summary

        
        
        
            
            
                
                    
                    
                        
                            Abstract: 
                            The Italian base in Antarctica is located at Terra Nova Bay inside the Ross sea 
 (Lat. 74 41'42'S, Long. 164 07'23'E). The expeditions are done during the 
 Antarctic summer and usually run from early December, till late February. The 
 first expedition was run in late 1985. 
 
 The research topics , which are related to the disciplines of the SCAR 
 Working Group, may be grouped into the following lines of  ... research: 
 
 - Biology 
 - Geodesy and Geographic Information 
 - Geology 
 - Glaciology 
 - Human Biology and Medicine 
 - Physics and Chemistry of Earth Atmosphere 
 - Solar terrestrial and Astrophysical Research 
 - Solid Earth Geophysics 
 
 The South-Pole Directory is the first goal of the project and is part 
 of the Italian System for Antarctic Data Exchange. This is planned to 
 contain on- or off-line all the main scientific results collected 
 during the Italian Antarctic expeditions, sponsored by the Italian 
 P.N.R.A. (National Program for Researches in Antarctica). 
 
 At present the Directory provides the user with the research and 
 available data description as well as the procedures for data 
 releasing. Data are available directly from the research-groups.
