\f0\fs22 \cf0 Step 7: Initially to identify the SWEET Ontologies the OWL files are parsed using TIKA and each of the unique ontology identified is stored in a map.\
Each of the file from the polar data set is taken and input and pared using Tika.\
Now, the data thus obtained is mapped with each of the hash map item to find a match with the polar dataset. Each time a match is obtained the count for the corresponding ontolgy is implemented and stored into another hash map. \
\
Finally the percent of polar dataset mapped to the SWEET ontology is visualized using D3.  \cf2 \
