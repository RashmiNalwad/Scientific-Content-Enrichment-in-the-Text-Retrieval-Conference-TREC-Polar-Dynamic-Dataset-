    Geospatial data and services are critical elements needed to meet the mission of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS), and remote sensing are the primary elements which fall under the geospatial data and services umbrella.
Geospatial services provide the technology to create, analyze, maintain, and distribute geospatial data and information. GIS, GPS and remote sensing play a vital role in all of the Serviceâs long-term goals and in analyzing and quantifying the USFWS Operational Plan Measures.
Nationally coordinated support for geospatial services, along with regional support and infrastructure, promotes cost savings and enables improved business practices. GIS, GPS and remote sensing can enable improved visualization, analysis, interoperability, modeling, and decision support. The benefits include increased accuracy, increased productivity, and more efficient information management and application support.

    Although elasmobranchs are widely distributed species, commonly found on sandy, gravely or muddy bottoms, several biological aspects of their metabolism still remain poorly investigated. In this work the efficiency of antioxidant system and detoxification enzymes were investigated in the coastal spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula and in the red mullet Mullus barbatus for comparison with a teleost species. Organisms were sampled during a bottom trawl survey and analyzed for the biotransformation activity (EROD), levels of metallothioneins, catalase, glutathione S-transferases and total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) toward peroxyl radicals and hydroxyl radicals. EROD activity in the elasmobranchs was more than one order of magnitude lower than in the red mullets, while similar levels of metallothioneins were measured in these species. S. canicula showed significantly lower antioxidant enzymes and a more reduced efficiency in neutralizing [Formula: see text] OH; on the other hand the scavenging capability toward ROO [Formula: see text] was comparable in S. canicula and M. barbatus.

    Tohoku University was founded in 1907 as the third Imperial University comprising the College of Agriculture and this year marks the 100th anniversary. The college of Agriculture dates its foundation back to the establishment of Sapporo Agricultural University, Hokkaido in 1876 (later renamed as Hokkaido Imperial University). In 1918, the College of Agriculture was ceded to Hokkaido Imperial University. While agricultural research center was established at Tohoku University in 1939, renewal of the College of Agriculture was not realized after the end of World War II.

    Millersville University is one of eight institutions participating in a recently funded National Science Foundation - Large Information Technology Research (ITR) Collaborative project called Linked Environments for Atmospheric Discovery (LEAD). This $11.25M, 5-year initiative also includes scientists and engineers from the University of Oklahoma, Colorado State University, University of Alabama-Huntsville, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Indiana University, Howard University, and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research - Unidata. LEADs mission is to enable an integrated, scalable framework for use in accessing, preparing, assimilating, predicting, managing, mining/analyzing, and displaying a broad array of meteorological and related information, independent of format and physical location. In practical terms, this project will dramatically impact the capability to provide timely warnings of severe weather events by developing the dynamics computing and networking infrastructure required for on-demand detection, simulation and prediction of high impact local weather such as thunderstorms, squall lines, lake-effect snows, and other mesoscale events. A transforming element of LEAD is the dynamic workflow orchestration, which will allow the use of analysis tools, forecast models, and data repositories not in fixed configurations or as static recipients of data, as is now the case, but rather as dynamically adaptive, on-demand systems that can a) change configuration rapidly and automatically in response to the weather; b) continually be steered by new data; c) respond to decision-driven inputs from users; d) initiate other processes automatically; and e) steer remote observing technologies to optimize data collection for the problem at hand.

          The Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (BCO-DMO) was created to serve PIs funded by the NSF Biological and Chemical Oceanography Sections as a location where marine biogeochemical, ecological and oceanographic data and information developed in the course of scientific research can easily be disseminated, protected, and stored on short and intermediate time-frames. Our main objective is to support the scientific community through improved access to ocean science data.

    Wildlife at Los Congos is thriving thanks to efforts by our park rangers to stop hunting within the preserve. Now that the animals are free again to wander as they please, we have encountered many new species. We have seen Lesser Ant Eaters, Agoutis, Collared Trogans, Prehensile Tailed Porcupines, and more deer scat in areas that the deer previously avoided. This is an amazing feat and we are happy to say that the Los Congos ecosystem is thriving.

    The Apollo program was designed to land humans on the Moon and bring them safely back to Earth. Six of the missions (Apollos 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17) achieved this goal. Apollos 7 and 9 were Earth orbiting missions to test the Command and Lunar Modules, and did not return lunar data. Apollos 8 and 10 tested various components while orbiting the Moon, and returned photography of the lunar surface. Apollo 13 did not land on the Moon due to a malfunction, but also returned photographs. The six missions that landed on the Moon returned a wealth of scientific data and almost 400 kilograms of lunar samples. Experiments included soil mechanics, meteoroids, seismic, heat flow, lunar ranging, magnetic fields, and solar wind experiments.

    The Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University was founded in 1961 by the renowned tropical meteorologist Professor Herbert Riehl. The department was originally assembled as a part of the Civil Engineering Department, but became an officially recognized department in March of 1962. Currently, the department operates under the College of Engineering. Computing capabilities include both data analysis and modeling systems that operate mainly on clusters located within the department. The department develops and operates several models including Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) and the General Circulation Model. Many smaller models are available to both researchers and graduate students.

    The NAS was signed into being by President Abraham Lincoln on March 3, 1863, at the height of the Civil War. As mandated in its Act of Incorporation, the NAS has, since 1863, served to "investigate, examine, experiment, and report upon any subject of science or art" whenever called upon to do so by any department of the government. Scientific issues would become even more contentious and complex in the years following the war. To keep pace with the growing roles that science and technology would play in public life, the institution that was founded in 1863 eventually expanded to include the National Research Council in 1916, the National Academy of Engineering in 1964, and the Institute of Medicine in 1970.

    DebianGis is about improving Debian to make it the best distribution for Geographical Information Systems applications and users. A good deal of GIS related softwares and libraries (e.g. GRASS, see http://grass.itc.it) are already present in Debian. Thanks to efforts of the DebianGis team, we have currently an up-to-date GRASS package in main and many other packages. Other programs are along their way to be included in the archive.

    In 1988, Region 5 established a partnership with students and faculty at Purdue University to develop two environmental software programs: Residential Waste Treatment Evaluation and Principles of Onsite Wastewater Treatment. By 1990 the partnership had produced six programs that ranged in complexity from simple linear tutorials to expert systems requiring the user to input data in order to receive a computer-calculated solution. All programs were developed for the IBM PC or compatibles. Our first programs were on water-related topics. The collection has grown to include new subjects such as solid waste, air pollution, and environmental assessment.

      6) GTE - Global Tropospheric Experiment. Data are collected primarily from aircraft and ground-based instruments from a variety of areas such as the Amazon Rain Forest and the Northern tundra and boreal forest.  Many parameters were measured including ozone, methane, PAN, CO, NO, nitrogen dioxide, carbon dioxide, and aerosols. The data are available via FTP and CD-ROM.       
      7) SAM II - Stratospheric Aerosol Measurement. This instrument was flown onboard the Nimbus-7 satellite and consisted of a one-spectral channel sun photometer, centered at 1.0 um, which viewed a small portion of the sun through the Earth's atmosphere during spacecraft sunrise and sunset.  The data obtained from this instrument were used to determine the vertical distribution of stratospheric aerosols in the polar regions of both hemispheres. These data are available via FTP  and CD-ROM.

    he Agriculture Network Information Center (AgNIC) Alliance was formed in 1995 by a group of four land grant institutions - Cornell University, Iowa State University, University of Arizona, and University of Nebraska, Lincoln, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Library (NAL). In 1998, NAL assumed the role as âsecretariatâ to move the partnership forward. Members were committed to creating a voluntary âallianceâ dedicated to providing Internet access to quality, authoritative agricultural information, and specialized reference services. In 2007, with 60 voluntary partners, this vision continues to sustain the Alliance, largely due to its collaborative nature. University libraries affiliated with land-grant colleges -- as well as other interested institutions, such as the International Rice Research Institute, the American Farmland Trust and the Agricultural Information and Documentation Service for America (SIDALC), are working together with NAL to develop the AgNIC Alliance, its collections and services, and the technologies upon which it relies.

The various research areas differ for the experimental facilities and the computational tools employed, as well as for the impact of their application but they share common methods of investigation and an identical approach in solving problems, which often leads rather distant areas to converge in addressing fundamental issues. Astrophysics and Particle Physics, for example, have given rise to Astroparticle Physics whose aim is to decipher signals from remote areas of the Universe and to study the very origin of the Universe itself. Another example is given by the theories and methods developed in statistical mechanics which have proved successful in modelling the functioning of complex biological systems.

Phenology refers to recurring plant and animal life cycle stages, or phenophases, such as leafing and flowering, maturation of agricultural plants, emergence of insects, and migration of birds. Many of these events are sensitive to climatic variation and change, and are simple to observe and record. As an USA-NPN observer, you can help scientists identify and understand environmental trends so we can better adapt to climate change

We explore and innovate at the intersection of the Geospatial and Information Sciences. Our research enables us to understand the spatial dimensions of critical decision processes. Spatial reasoning involves visualizing and interpreting patterns of location, distance, relationship, movement and change through space and time. Spatial reasoning is a critical skill for solving problems in contemporary society: problems with complex factors embedded in highly interdependent systems that cross multiple spatial and temporal scales.

    A university is a unique and wonderful structural part of a society. It offers knowledge, helps to form values, and nurtures individuals. Around the world, major social changes, paradigm shifts and the seeds of technological innovation have, in many cases, been sown in a university. University research and education are investments for the future. A research institute in a university that guarantees future value has an important mission of providing graduate education in the latest academic findings and hands-on research experience, along with departments on the main campus, which are more directly responsible for the teaching of conventional disciplines. Our institute has fulfilled this responsibility as a prototype of a research-oriented graduate university, and has produced major results since the establishment of a new graduate school system following the Second World War.

    Geologic time is the intellectual theme that connects a wide variety of research endeavors in geoscience - missing is the corresponding cyberinfrastructure that allows the resources of all these endeavors to be pooled. CHRONOS&amp;#039;s (Greek: time) purpose is to transform Earth history research by seamlessly integrating geoscience databases and tools.
    Recognising this and the enormous scope and benefits offered by solid earth simulation, the ACES International Science Board agreed to work towards establishment of a frontier international research institute on simulating the solid earth. The institute will consist of a node in each participating country, and will build on complementary national programs, centers and facilities for solid earth simulation. The institute's focus will be development of predictive capabilities for solid earth phenomena via simulation and breakthrough science using the computational simulation capabilities aimed at understanding solid earth system complexity.

    The World Data Center for Geophysics, Beijing, is one of major promoter to push Chinese geo-data organizations to join WDC system. The Center was supported by The Ministry of Science and Technology and Chinese Academy of Sciences, and was relying on The Institute of Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The institute was founded in 1950, based on the department of geomagnetism of the Institute of Physics, former Central Academy of Science. The institute was the one of the major founder of modern Chinese geophysics, including geophysics, atmospheric physics, space physics and spaceflight. In 1999, The Institute of Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences and The Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, were combined into a new institute, that is The Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Now The World Data Center for Geophysics, Beijing, is relying on the new institute. With the support of the institute, CAS and Ministry of Science and Technology, an internet web system has been completed.

In 1964, the Spanish Institute of Oceanography was established Spanish Oceanographic Data Center, under the System of National Oceanographic Data Centres (NODCs) established by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). The IEO Data Center is built in different international data networks, with a common goal of all these, the development of format standards and protocols to facilitate the exchange control and data integration so that it has been possible to draw products regionally and globally. 
The development of new instrumentation for data collection and new information technologies and the demand for near real-time information and diversity of institutions with responsibility in this matter, requires a new approach regarding the management of data and information. Just recently, NODCs committee constituted a commission to analyze the situation and carry out the necessary structure in the "International Oceanographic Data Exchange (IODE). However, an issue to be resolved at the institutional and national level is the development of legislation to regularize the rights and obligations of generating data and information and the conditions of use of such information.

There are other, excellent open source applications that can display PostGIS data sets (like QGis or GRASS). Those projects, however, expect properly indexed tables as an input, and don't provide a built-in functionality to launch SQL queries. The focus of mezoGIS is to stay close to the SQL workflow: Spatial queries are launched through manually entered SQL commands, and result sets containing geometry are displayed as map layers.

    Development of COSMOS is continuing with a number of activities and initiatives. A workshop on âInstrumental Systems for Diagnostics of Seismic Response of Bridges and Damsâ was successfully held and âRecommended Guidelinesâ were published. The COSMOS Strong Motion Programs Board completed the guideline âGuidelines for Advanced National Seismic System Strong Motion Station Installationâ with funding provided by the U. S. Geological Survey. Development of the COSMOS Strong Motion Virtual Data Center (VDC) is continuing on four fronts: improvement of the user interface to make data more accessible for users; the COSMOS strong motion data format has been approved as a standard; data being held directly in the VDC continue to be expanded; and work is being initiated to develop a mirror sites. Two workshops are in planning: âArchiving and Web Dissemination of Geotechnical Dataâ is scheduled to be held on October 4 and 5, 2001; and, âStrong Motion Instrumentation of Buildingsâ is scheduled to be held on November 14 and 15, 2001. In an effort to expand strong motion recording in earthquake prone areas of the world that have few or no current strong motion stations, COSMOS and the World Seismic Safety Initiative (WSSI) have entered into an agreement to facilitate deployment of surplus instruments.

German polar research is carried out by university institutes, federal research institutes, Max Planck Institutes as well as by AWI itself. the Institute has cooperative agreements with several universities. Scientists of the Institute teach at the University of Bremen, but also in Kiel, Munich, Muenster, and Oldenburg.
The focal point of the research programme - The system ocean - ice - atmosphere and its importance for the world climate - mainly comprises physical projects: oceans, atmosphere and ice are subject to various interactions over periods ranging from a few days to some hundred years. Through measurements and modeling scientists of the AWI study the exchange processes in the polar seas, the ocean currents in the Southern and Northern polar seas, as well as structure, mass balance and dynamics of shelf and inland ice. Remote sensing of the ocean, the atmosphere, and of inland and sea ice has been intensified during the recent years.
